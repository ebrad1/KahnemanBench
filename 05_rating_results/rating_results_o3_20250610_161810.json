It conveys nuance (evolutionary yet radical), stays coherent, and fits Kahneman\u2019s known views. Minor drawbacks: the \u201coutside my area of expertise\u201d disclaimer is odd coming from Kahneman, and the answer could add a bit more detail on specific theoretical shifts.

It concludes that \u201ceconomics is still pretty much the same discipline,\u201d clearly conveying that the change was more fine-tuning than revolution.
