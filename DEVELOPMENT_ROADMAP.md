## Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Core Functionality
1. **Run Claude Code** with the website completion prompt we created
2. **Test Public Demo**: Ensure `/try` works with sample questions
3. **Test Expert Mode**: Verify file upload and rating interface work
4. **Generate Expert Codes**: Create system for unique expert tracking
5. **Data Export**: Verify expert responses can be exported properly

### Week 2: Polish & Testing
1. **UI Improvements**: Based on initial testing feedback
2. **Expert Workflow**: End-to-end testing with real rating datasets
3. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure expert mode works on different devices
4. **Documentation**: Instructions for expert participants
5. **Vercel Preparation**: Set up deployment pipeline

## Success Metrics

### Phase 5 (Website) Success Criteria:
- âœ… Public demo works without crashes
- âœ… Expert mode successfully collects ratings from JSON datasets
- âœ… Expert tracking system identifies individual contributors
- âœ… Data export contains all necessary information for analysis
- âœ… UI is intuitive for non-technical expert participants

### Phase 6 (Deployment) Success Criteria:
- âœ… Website accessible at production URL
- âœ… Multiple experts can use system simultaneously
