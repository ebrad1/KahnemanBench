Host: "Foreign that we are incredibly thrilled and honoured um to have Daniel Coleman with us today and we're incredibly grateful to you Danny for making a trip all the way from New York thank you most of you will know Danny and the fact that he received the Nobel Prize in economics for his incredible work on judgment and decision making and pretty much starting the field of Behavioral economics but in preparing for for this interview I also looked up Danny's Google Scholar page and I couldn't believe my eyes so for the academics in the room sit tight Danny has 486 000 academic citations I see some people I know I'm not raising the collective well-being of the academics in the room by saying this for the non-academics as an academic throughout your career you can probably Aspire too if you do really well about 10 15 000 academic citations so we're sitting arm sitting and we're all sitting in front of a legend here um most of you will have read his book Thinking Fast and Slow um which brings all his wonderful research together in an accessible way what not all of you will know or what is slightly less known out there in the public is that danius had a very and seems to continue to have a very impactful line of research on happiness and well-being which he coined as experienced utility in the context of Economics we tend to talk about decision utility or reveal preferences um it's also that line of research I found that over the years that Danny started I think late 80s early 90s inspired people like Richard Laird Paul Dolan who's here with us today as well to really turn their attention to this to this line of research and terms so thank you Danny for inspiring what are now becoming mentors to many other people let me start by asking your original story um why did you take an interest or how did you come around to taking an interest in happiness and as well experienced utility".
Daniel Kahneman: "Okay it's a long story uh when I was working with amostursky on prospect theory so that was in in the late 70s I invented a puzzle and the puzzle with this imagine that you have an illness that requires you for treatment to receive one injection every day and it's painful uh and you don't adapt because it's once a day how much would you pay to reduce the number of injections say from 20 to 15 or from 10 to 5. and it's immediately obvious that you wouldn't pay the same amount and yet you should pay the same amount and so clearly there was a distinction here between the utility that is experienced where 20 is clearly twice as much as 10 and and the decision utility so that that was in the back of my mind and and I knew that sometime you know I would get back to it and to that project and much much later in the late 80s and early 90s I I actually got to the question of whether people can predict their future enjoyment of things and whether people can correctly remember experiences that they have had and evaluate experiences that they have had and the there was a paradoxical result which is quite easy to to duplicate we first found it in a questionnaire actually and then we we confirmed it in various ways which is that if you take an unpleasant episode and you add and and you add to it you add more unpleasantness but diminishing unpleasantness the memory or the global evaluation or the entire episode improves and so that led to the formulation of something that they're called the peak and Rule but mainly it led to the idea that experience and how you think about your experience are completely separate things and at the time I thought that experience is reality and that what we think about experience is just you know it's just biased judgment and and the biases are interesting but I thought there is reality in and so that's where that's how I began my work on well-being that's what the origin of the work and will be in the late 1990s I think I was invited by Richard layer to give a series of talks at LSC and I think I presented that work in one of the lectures and it was cleared or it appeared to be clear that life that well-being research was being conducted with life satisfaction questions but life satisfaction is a judgment so I thought oh all of this we can redo the study of Life of well-being with experience and we'll find completely different things so I engage in that exercise with a with colleagues we developed the the Dairy construction method that was just mentioned and that's how I became interested sorry for the very long answer but I'm not going to answer all questions at that time I promise".
Host: "But then I think people are here to to hear you and to hear these stories um I do want to we'll get back into because throughout the conference we've had a lot of information already about evaluative measures life satisfaction and the more experienced matters such as um affect and unhappiness in the moment the experience of it itself we'll get back to that in a second but I want to dig a little bit into that story of how the economics world and got to find out about your amazing work and I think you were the first one to in one of the very top economic journals the quarterly Journal of economics in 97 published a piece called back to Bentham explorations of experienced utility and I was wondering at the time it was very much still field preferences decision utility the ordinal measure of utility that economists were using and to some extent are still using today what was the reception of that famous piece that hit the very best journals what your colleagues at Princeton in the economics Department that they dismissed this that like this what did they think".
Daniel Kahneman: "You know I think the it was ignored I mean you know like everything else that the psychologists do so I don't the Nobel actually made a lot of difference so after the Nobel it was it's been you know it's been read much more but the initial reaction was very little interest I think and and I should add this was published after remostovsky's death in a special issue in his memory so it was barely refereed if it all and if it had been refereed I'm not sure it would have been published so we know of another famous paper a few years later in the American Economic Review one of the other big places by uh Andrew Oswald and others which did go through proper review and it also didn't make it almost because of very tough referees you mentioned already your interest in the field came through these the colonoscopy studies and others with the pecan Rule and the the fact that sometimes um evaluations of or memories of the experience don't quite suit what actually happened uh but then in a piece in 2018 and I I've got a copy with me here Danny did an interview with Harrod's magazine and the title of the piece uh was the follo".
Host: "Wing Nobel Prize why Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman gave up on happiness as a title obviously very attention grabbing luckily there is a byline but yet now considers life satisfaction of Greater importance as you can imagine in the field of well-being science that was circulating quite widely I didn't know that and we're keen to hear how um you may not want to fully transition I gather but how you feel today about um which of the two measures could be an optimal Criterion for policy makers or individuals to strive to optimize is it the experience or is it the memory of the experience".
Daniel Kahneman: "Well uh so I've started out with a position that it's the experience and that you know life evaluation is it's just the biased judgment uh and I was I held that position for for quite a few years and eventually something hit me which is that life satisfaction well let me add we had a group that I set up and and the group was the idea of the group was to get economists interested in well-being I mean the two Andrews had were there but they were pretty isolated I brought Alan Krueger who was a famous the late Alan krugeroo very well-known Economist at Princeton and a whole group to develop an instrument to measure experience that was that the day reconstruction myth and it enabled us to look at quite specifically what predicts life satisfaction and what predates emotional happiness and it only turns out you know they're different in obvious ways so life satisfaction is largely predictable as conventional success so our idea of success in life is widely accepted and people measure themselves by roughly by that Criterion happiness is primarily at least in our work it seemed to be determined primarily by who you are with by whether you're people with people you like in a pleasant interaction and and a lot of so income was much more predictive of one than it was predictive of the other there was those very large differences so we knew that but then they know something hit me that that I should have seen earlier about life satisfaction which is that life satisfaction is what people actually want that is when when people set goals for themselves and make decisions long-term decisions uh they're looking they're actually the term that th".
Daniel Kahneman: "Ey use they're serving their remembering self that is they're evaluating the outcomes they're anticipating their memories and this is what they're they want to maximize in short people want to have a good story for their life and so I discovered that I had a theory of well-being that didn't correspond to what people wanted for themselves and that seemed extremely awkward and it's not that I gave up on unhappiness I gave up on happiness as a dissolution and it's not the very adopted life evaluation it's just that I became totally puzzled and baffled and I didn't know how to solve it and I moved on to other things but hopefully this conference brings you back into some extent certainly but can I push a little bit on that point how do we know that people may prefer the story of their life life evaluations over the experience of it well how do we know that when you look at the determinants of Life satisfaction those are turned out to be goals that you know many people aspire to they they turn out to be how people evaluate each other as well as how they evaluate themselves so that's that's pretty obvious and it's also obvious actually that if we wanted to maximize our experience we wouldn't know how to do it because all we get to keep from our experience is our memories and so maximizing experience is a very difficult thing it's an art that maybe you know maybe it's learnable maybe it's teachable but it's very different from life satisfaction and what brings life satisfaction thank you Danny".
Host: "Um I want to change talk a little bit back in 2012 I received an email from you and as a junior scholar this is the kind of stuff but obviously uh you never forget and by the way I I've heard of a number of Junior Scholars after publishing a paper that you send them a note congratulating them on a paper or pushing their thinking a little bit further so I want to thank you for that and I know the other Junior Scholars at the time also really appreciate that so thank you but in that email which I looked up again to get the actual text and it's something that has resonated with me ever since and I've been looking for which is you you wrote something I'm increasingly troubled by the problem of labeling labeling results by one pole o".
Host: "F a dimension which reflects deep linguistic habits rather than the structure of the data for example and it's so simple and so clever this example and yet so telling uh suppose that I suppose that being very short is more likely to make one miserable than being very tall to make one happy but the relationship would still be described as connecting happiness to height and I've seen that also picked up in um in in studies where a lot of the action is often driven by the bottom end of the well-being scale um yet it's described as matching X to well-being or happiness but can you can you elaborate a bit on this for us because I know it still is something that you care much about".
Daniel Kahneman: "Oh yes and that's one of the few points I think where Richard Laird and I disagree I mean I have always thought that we should be studying misery and that and that and that the objective of social policy should be to reduce misery rather than to increase happiness and in part this was because the dominant view of what increasing happiness was at at that time like 15 20 years ago with positive psychology and positive psychology aimed to change the way you think about your life which which is nice in a way but it's also very conservative message in some sense it doesn't so much matter to improve your circumstances or to change your life as to make you happier with whatever whatever it is that you have so I was questioning that and I thought that producing misery is should be the objective and that the focus on happiness which is really linguistic uh it's like you know we measure length and not shortness uh that the focus of Happiness was guiding us in a different direction if we were thinking of objectives of policy that's what I thought let me say that this conference shows that that I was wrong but I thought that if you focus on happiness you wouldn't focus on reducing misery that was my it turns out that Richard Laird focused on happiness and on the reduction of misery and that's very clear in this conference and in the book that you've written that I've just read that many people are thinking about this and that you know and in terms of talking to the public then happiness is a much better word than misery that's that's clean thank you t".
Host: "Hough so I'm glad we can get to stay Scholars of happiness and well-being but perhaps put some extra weights on the people at the bottom of the distribution scale I want to ask you for all of us especially the young scholars in the room what are some of the big next research Frontiers that you see where you've seen some of the sessions today you've been thinking about this quite a lot where do you see the research Frontier where is it genetics is it experience sampling there is a Twitter data where do you think the exciting new avenues for our understanding of well-being will come from".
Daniel Kahneman: "You know we never asked a forecasting question uh I'm reminded of a of a Hebrew proverb which said that prophecy Is For Fools and and I really don't you know I don't have any forecasts I think that it's obvious that if you want to know what's going to be interesting in in the next 20 years and 30 years you should be looking at what graduate students are doing now you know I personally am fascinated by the brain I'm fascinated by artificial intelligence and by genetics you know I think that those are big departures but I wouldn't forecast that this is really what's going to happen thank you Danny um it's been a great privilege to me to be able to sit here and ask a few questions but I think I should and I would want to share their privilege with everyone in the room who if if you have a question for Danny um please raise your hand and we'll make sure um that uh Stewart gets to you with a microphone I must say it's a real pleasure to be able to ask a question like this if you think about all the things that you discovered think of the things you discovered not just pure ideas looking back what do you think was the thing that most surprised you the one discovery that sticks in your mind is you would really not expecting that is there one it's very hard to say because when you really understand something then it seemed that you understood it always so uh I think that the discovery that excited me the most that of Discovery was was that people make non-regressive predictions and ignore base rates when they're making predictions that was that was quite new to me and surprising and exciting other things that I've worked on are typically".
Daniel Kahneman: "Sort of main effects that are pretty obvious to introspections so I I haven't I haven't had deep theoretical insights that you know I deal with obvious things questions ah mark thank you so much for this opportunity".
Mark Williamson: "Mark Williamson from action for happiness you talked about alleviating misery as opposed to promoting happiness but I'd love to ask you about this sort of action side of that which is at two different levels really what would be your top recommendation from what you've looked at for a policy maker big picture to try and alleviate misery where we're struggling and also from an individual perspective so many people are struggling right now with low well-being what would be your top insight for an individual to try and help them get further up that that well-being scale".
Daniel Kahneman: "Well you know in terms of software policy what I'm going to say is Trivial to all of you I would say mental health and loneliness you know would be the first obvious concerns and and I think that that they're widely accepted as as aims as goals for policy I would say something very similar to what we just heard that time is a very limited resource and spending it well is at the most important decision that you're going to make and making decisions and constraining yourself in the sense of setting up habits and setting up structures that that make you use your time wisely would be my best advice I don't personally follow it much but uh Casper I haven't you haven't given me the opportunity to say something that I wanted to say that my my main contribution to the study of well-being has been was really to get Richard LED interested in it and my that is really something uh that I feel very proud of actually uh and I actually made another contribution that's not well known I participated in the setting up of the World Poll and I actually wrote the emotion questions and it turns out which I didn't know that they convinced Jim Clifton who directed The Gallup at the time to to use the Cantrell ladder which I know John doesn't like but can I belabor that point a little bit as though because we've now been talking about um different definitions of well-being and what could be optimized so it's more conceptual in nature but the latest data we saw".
Host: "This morning some of the larger Trends in well-being by John and others um what I know that you've been reading the Jim cliff and son John Clifton's work and his recent piece in the economist about the disturbing trends that we're seeing on negative emotions and do you want to elaborate a little bit on that".
Daniel Kahneman: "Yeah I mean you know when I've is clear from the Gallup data I mean that's a huge change it's like 10 percent increase over the last decade in negative emotions so when you see a finding of that magnitude I think your first thought ought to be is there an artifact I mean and but what I what I gather is that actually there are many data from other sources that broadly confirm it and this is huge because you know things are really very stable in the domain of uh and to see it to see such a change and 10 is enormous can I it's actually worse than 10 I looked up the statistics in the last decade it increased negative emotions globally increased 20 percent so and it's especially worry and stress have moved up with about um what was it about 25 of people experiencing them on a day-to-day basis in 2010 and that's now up to well above 30 of the time that people are experiencing these negative emotions on a day-to-day basis what's really striking I think is what I meant by 10 was not 10 percent of how it was I meant 10 in absolute terms in terms data it goes from 25 to 35 percent thank you Danny you're right the I do want to point out I I find that personally very disturbing too in no small part because it's against the backdrop of growth low in employment and the pandemic obviously exacerbated this trend um and now at the end of the pandemic has come back on that negative Trend uh that it was on so it is something that I think we as well-being Scholars should really be sounding the alarm bells on just like Andrew Oswald did this morning or John Clifton is doing in his pieces is that these negative emotions are such a rising Trend that um it should be active upon yeah I mean I certainly resonated to Andrew's talk this morning that you know this looks like something that's getting ready to explode certainly in the United States questions um oh Casper oh you Casper you're ready to go thank you".
Casper: "So I know that you're th".
Casper: "At you're not a prophet um but but you were involved in both the experience sampling method and the the day reconstruction method so I'm just wondering what do you think how will we maybe globally measure well-being in 30 years".
Daniel Kahneman: "Uh well I mean I have no idea really uh clearly one thing that we didn't anticipate when we did the day reconstruction method it we thought of it as a very as a substitute for experience sampling which was Impractical you know then shortly thereafter the the iPhone came on the scene and the problem was saw it's going you know we're going to continue to measure experience that's clear it's also clear already so I'm not making you know long-term prophecies about 30 years from now but wearables are going to to come you know we're going to know a lot more about what happens to our bodies and and this is going to happen soon it's it's happening now and certainly those things are going to interact and to be used together uh Paul Dolan and then we'll go to the other side about 60 of people choose to be choose to maximize life satisfaction over happiness and 40 of our sample choose to maximize happiness over life sat so that's the first point I made um the second point is time use we all agree is absolutely Central to our own happiness and well-being that does require us I think to measure experiences more directly um and then the third point was very quickly on the motivation and the goals that individuals have is a not necessarily the best yardstick by which to judge which measure people should use because we know that people make all sorts of mistakes and errors in their in assessing happiness can you oh boy now I think the first question really is Paul did some work uh survey work at the end with LLC students showing that 60 of them do indeed prefer life satisfaction but that's not an overwhelming majority either so I think Paul thank you so I think but Paul is cautioning you a little bit on that move from affect to life evaluations yeah on on that question uh I think that what guides people in the in their long-term decisions is not a view of experience and and I was talking long-term decisions not the you know if I'm if I'm asked do I prefer you know something today or something tomorrow t".
Daniel Kahneman: "Hen I prefer something today uh that's clear and I prefer experiences when they are short-term I was referring to the long term and in the long term I don't even know what it would mean to try to maximize experience but clearly maximizing success in life for maximizing life satisfaction which is really I think I don't know which is a proxy for which but it's clear that what defines life satisfaction in terms of its predictors is really quite conventional success and much less experience I knew my name is Nova genevi I came from United Arab Emirates University it's a it's an honor to see you in person my question for you is an advice that you would give to a new researcher like myself sometimes those who are interested in the field of well-being sometimes I find myself I'm talking about my experience and my colleagues as well that we struggle between defining well-being measuring well-being educating well-being and trying to influence policy makers at the same time what advice would you give us".
Daniel Kahneman: "I wouldn't give you any advice you know I'm you know there is a lot of diversity people pick different things to do and the the mix more or less works out and more or less corrects itself and I you know as individuals you really have the luxury of choosing your problems and that would be the advice I would give which is really it right thank you I think we've got time for two more questions uh yeah thank you Amanda thank you very much um so you were talking about how particularly around emotional happiness it's so much about who we are with so the importance of social connection and not feeling lonely but I was wondering if you've done any research or have considered also looking into a lot of the like data around how our relationship with nature and spending time also in nature has huge impacts on our our happiness clearly that's something that you know studied experience sampling I'm sure are going to bring out to light that this is a huge effect on how people feel it's the weather it's nature it's you know it's trees Greenery water and it and there are children in you know Urban the urban poor who've never seen nature making that part of Education and making sure that everybody knows the joys of nature that I think is".
Daniel Kahneman: "A worthy policy objective that's not about reducing misery but it's really about something positive it's the wonderful work done by George McCarron and mappiness and these kind of experience based sampling using geotags as part of a iPhone pulse surveys they've really been able to show very concretely the proximity to green or blue spaces like the Thames for example and the Royal happiness report chapter very positively related to how you feel and especially if it's with other people that you enjoy spending time with and even more so if you're doing it actively by moving such as joking together last question yes just going back to the idea of this experience versus the memory of you know mindfulness which I know Richard's a big fan of as well we talk a lot about you know focusing so much about being in the present moment and not worrying about the future or ruminating about the past and how do you acknowledge how do you marry that with saying okay let's focus on life satisfaction or memory of things when we know a lot of research is showing that more mindful we are the more we are in the present moment the happier we are and there is you know mindfulness is actually highly active I mean you're doing nothing but it's that that you're actually completely focused and I was interested when we were mentioning television earlier and the amount of Television watching that there is television and mindfulness are both passive physically but they're radically different and so it's not that when you watch television it's not that you're in the moment you you are nowhere in some sense and so being in the moment is a very different art yes thank you um I wanted to say when we started the conference planning we became pretty clear to us that we wanted to come up with Awards or prizes to recognize exceptional research and contributions at different stages in people's careers and the first of three prizes that we thought up was the distinguished career award and um Danny featured Tai on the list to begin with when we found out he was actually coming it was decided pretty soon and direct who we would want to award the distinguished career award in well-being science too now we we were joking at the center needless to say that i".
Host: "T doesn't quite figure next to a Nobel Prize but but but Danny please consider this a heartfelt thank you from everybody in the well-being science community thank you".
