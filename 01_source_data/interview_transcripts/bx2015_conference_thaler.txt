Interview 9. Behavioral Exchange Conference (BX2015):

Richard: Probably the first thing I should say about Daniel Kahneman is that Daniel is in New York so we have a very special an absolutely foolproof cannot possibly go wrong live link-up provided courtesy of Cisco so down this link up Richard will be interviewing Danny Daniel Kahneman is of course best work for his best known for his work with Amos Tversky the late Amos Tversky for which he won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2002 he's also very widely known for his popular psychology book I mean that in the sense of it sold a lot rather than that dumbed they field down which was thinking fast and slow those of you paying attention to what Daniel is doing will know he's written and published very very widely not just in fields that we would associate with behavioral economics and he's also been involved in trying to improve standards replication in psychology so a very important influential individual both in economics and of course in his own field of psychology so it is my great pleasure to welcome Daniel Kahneman to the screen and Richard Taylor to the stage I can see you Danny can you see me yeah okay yeah yeah you look very smoky grace oh thank you thank you thank you I as you know I don't put a tie on for just anybody so I appreciate that yeah thank you thank you yeah so let me start with this you and Amos had one of the most successful academic collaborations in all of science and much of your other work is joint we have lots of aspiring young academics here and aspiring people in all kinds of fields any advice what makes a good collaboration out how have you pulled it off or is it just luck.
Daniel: There's a lot of luck you know you've got to like the people you're collaborating with it really doesn't work otherwise and they've got to like you and that's now you miss out you know I'm telling you but I've just confessed to liking you and I'm sorry because in our interaction I should be but that's it I mean you have to enjoy working that way it's  a slow way to work certainly it's slow for my collaborators and they can all they can all guarantee that it's a slow way to work it can be very frustrating but if you're doing the social interaction then it's is pretty wonderful and then in some truly magical cases and I think Amos and I had that magic and to some extent even you and I had a bit of magic then then the two are simply superior to either one alone and it can be because they have complementary skills or because they have complementary knowledge or it can be because they have complementary characters and are able to eat them you know that were the case for Amos and me I think each of us brought out the best in the other and Amos couldn't understand the very vague things I commonly say better than I did and that was certainly one of the big things that that made our work possible yeah you certainly seemed to be having more fun with Amos than when you were writing your book well that's not a big thing to say no that's yeah that was acutely miserable when I wrote the book and it was a very lonely experience so yeah you've been doing some private sector consulting work on noise reduction which does not seem to have affected the noise level in restaurants so you must be working on something else good could you tell us a bit about what that is and let's start with that2....
Daniel: Sure you know there are many organizations in which you have lots of people essentially doing very similar jobs or making similar kinds of decisions on behalf of the organization so you can have people approving loans I mean now there's a lot of robots approving loans but you also have people approving on you can have people picking stocks you can have you can have financial advisers making decisions about who they will which client they would see I mean they're just thousands of examples and when I would define as noise is that when you have two people making similar decisions or essentially the same decision on behalf of the organization if they don't make the same decision that's noise and we already know from psychological research that there is a lot of noise I mean people if there is internal noise people are not when you show them the same information twice even if it's an x-ray by the way people are very likely to give you different answers turns out my sense is this problem is completely ignored in organizations so I can't describe my client but the client with whom we worked has a lot of people making very similar decisions with fairly high states for themselves for the organizations and for their clients and I asked them the question if you have two people facing exactly the same problem and it's a numerical problem they're making decisions that involves quantities when you think the variability will be relative to the mean what's the average difference that you expect between two randomly people facing the same problem and oddly enough you get five to ten percent as an answer in many contexts and since the blue in that organization we could try because we could create materials show the same materials with 40 people and actually measure what is the average distance between two individual it's about 40% and we replicated that more than once it didn't come as a surprise to me because I knew the psychological literature it came as a complete surprise to the organization and that is very interesting I mean how come you get people making decision they respect each other there is what psychologists call false consensus everyone assumes that other good people would make exactly the same decision they do very rarely do two people independently make the same decision so have noise and turned other noise I don't not invariably but in every example that I've thought about no it is actually there costly so I'm interested in noise it's a problem that hasn't been recognized people think of bias you know most of my life I studied wise but then but noise has interesting characteristics it's easier actually to control noise than to control bias because you can control noise without knowing the correct answer and that's what I engaged so how do you distinguish between noise which is bad and diversity of opinion which is good3....
Richard: Well the point about diversity of opinion is that it's overt and something comes out of it and it's and you have I mean evolutionary noise is a very wonderful thing you know you get many so longer there is a selection process that selects the better over the worse but so you have that in diversity presumably people are solving the same problem and they know when it's all and diversity can help in some problems and many problems there those are the helps noise is silent actually mean it's an absurd thing to say that noise in silent people don't know that it exists so they don't correct for it so yes sir you're referring to a situation where you have lots of people doing the same thing independently absolutely and coming up with very different answers as opposed to collaborating least Wester then this morning mentioned that psychologists have been trying to disabuse people of the idea of doing interviews for 50 years or so with little success what is there anything from your project that might help make interviews less noisy4....
Daniel: Well yes I mean actually there is you know there is a general strategy for dealing with noise and what it involved is breaking up problems into elements dealing with the elements according to a reasonably straightforward and agreed-upon technique and then combining them according to a rule so there are interview system that worked like that but they devised you know my thinking about this I devised an interview system like that for the Israeli army since six years ago and it's based on taking the various aspects that you want to look at and dealing with in sequentially and as independently as possible and scoring each of them and that reduces noise so adding structure adding structure that concise summary makes me feel that I'm rambling I could have said I cured you of rambling 30 years ago I know I know you know you haven't you haven't rambled since that's good so what do you what have you learned from this experience in terms of dealing with large organizations so how do you get buy-in how I mean you're telling them things that they initially resist how do you get from here to there because we have you probably eight nine hundred people here some of whom are trying to influence governments and you know you get some result and then somebody says you know you're just some psychologist what the hell do you know how do you get past that5.
Richard: Well I mean especially if you don't Nobel Prize.
Daniel: I think I think every consultant should have one because it actually does make things a lot easier yes that's so there's an unfair advantage right there but you know who said anything about getting there I mean you know getting from here it's it's quite chancy whether or not you have influence someone's my the best ideas I've had I've gotten absolutely nowhere somebody must be and that's a chance event must be interested in in doing that it's very important not to step on you know if the change you want to introduce will cause somebody to lose status and he's in a position to block you then you'll get blocked and I mean there is no guarantee on those things the government's might be easier I suppose but I'm not sure they are and dealing with things that don't defend any money and that don't violate the procedure that people already follow in ways that that would cause someone to lose status or prestige or power that this is related to it another point I know you feel strongly about which is that in designing any kind of policy we need to worry about who the losers are going to be you want to elaborate on that a little bit oh yeah I you know I believe it loss of that's but I what I believe is that when you are introducing change in most situations when you are introducing change doesn't leave social arrangements neutral there'll be winners and there will be losers and there is I think a basic rule the losers the potential losers fight a lot harder than the potential winners and when you look at reforms typically and being more expensive than anticipated and usually buy a lot and I think it's that that mechanism is it work as an interesting finding in the study of the endowment issue and one of the more interesting ones that I think is by a friend dragnet agents don't seem to have an endowment effect whether they don't anticipate the kind of loss aversion that their clients will fear reformers are like agents leaders are like agents they don't anticipate loss of virtue they think the final state will be good it's all wonderful in fact then create winners and create losers they'll have to compensate the losers for their loss and it will end up being more effective and sometimes it will fail and all of that I think because of the existence of losers so that would be even the first piece of advice that I give to anyone interested in bringing change to any organization who are the losers going to be and what are they going to be able to do to you well but it's difficult to know how you make them whole5....
Richard: I remember a problem you and I tried to solve about your stepdaughter leaving high school a year early where my very stupid advice got you know where it was to buy hundred Jaguar yeah a car of her choice was well you can't always you know make them whole but sometimes you can and here the basic idea is one that is also at the foundation of nurtures and it's the cool tipping idea figure out what is going to hurt what are people actually going to lose what are they why when is preventing them from already doing what you want them to do and sometimes if you just think about reducing their resistance finding ways to compensate them finding ways to alleviate the loss you can reduce the resistance very substantially but you have to be aware of it it's not always going to be possible but in many situations that actually is especially when you're dealing with issues of status prestige power there are ways of arranging things so that you can minimize the hood so the this morning in my talk I was saying that nudge and behavioral insights have largely rested on the work of Kurt Lewin and Bob Chiellini who's here and you and Amos and that there are more psychologists and social scientists out in the world and that we should broaden our horizons are there parts of psychology that you think deserved more attention from practitioners that are ripe for practical implications I'm not sure I mean I you know I hadn't I hadn't prepared for that so I haven't thought there are many things that that we could do that the people are already in that field and operating in that space could do that they're not doing so there are whole areas of potential application of you know what is called with many people call behavioral economics and I call applied social psychology most of the time there are many areas where we could do think that we're not doing it in MoMA yeah I guess what I mean it couldn't work either way it could be that we try to recruit psychologists who don't normally think of playing in the policy domain or it could be reading those psychologists and realizing that they have insights that could be used in in any of the you know reducing crime or well you know obesity or what whatever problem we're trying to nudge6....
Daniel: Yeah I mean clearly there are experts in in a lot of in the love of areas and but my guess is that people are interested in crime reduction are in some ways already active in that space so it's a matter of bringing them of reaching out to them and bringing them to you and creating that association so I'm not I'm not making it clear what up well what I'm saying is are the are those of us who are busy nudging missing branches of pure psychology that I mean if I surprised you with this so I mean I mean the answer is I'm sure there are my god but you get but you don't have one at the top of your head health and you have something I do have an answer to another question oh well I might get to it either one you know don't ya okay here's one that you said you were willing to talk about you know I couldn't make this so easy to give all the questions in advance this was a question that someone on the team suggested which is do you worry and how worried should have this crowd be by the recent replication study well I think psychologists should be very worried about it I think you know they I think as it happens this fraud has less reason to worry then than most psychologists and the probe has less reason to worry because experimentation is built into the DNA of that approach and so long as that is kept that you do everything in control randomized controlled experiments and not before after mostly but actually randomized control then you guarantee your own replication and so you I don't I think psychology should be worried psychologists should be worried but this particular crowd has less reason to worry than most meaning that if something works someone else will try it and so it will get replicated and it's yes not at every trial that that the nudge unit runs will replicate if it's done again well that's an interesting that's an interesting issue because you're absolutely right that's the experimentation doesn't guarantee replication that failures of replication are failures to replicate experiments and but the point is you know if you have randomly selected your crowd from a relevant environment and you have done it appropriately the chances that it will replicate in that environment and with7....
Richard: That population are really quite high if you want to do it in another context what you learn from the replication issue is that changes in context that we don't expect will make a difference are likely to make a difference so I would say whenever you really move any significant step away from the experiment redo the experiment in your new context so I think you also agreed to answer the following question which is how should young scholars think about choosing topics of research not what should they study because I know you're not gonna give advice about that well I'm not going to give advice about choosing a topic study I mean you know it's sort of going to sound completely trivial don't study anything that is not fun for you to study I mean really don't do that don't ask yourself whether what you're doing is likely to be interesting once you have done it so it should be fun to do it should the answer that you expect to get so that you hope to get should be interesting and you should know and that's the hardest thing you should know how long to persevere when things are not going well not too long if it isn't going well and you have tried a couple of times give up and get another idea and if you can't get another idea do something else I mean I don't do research I think you sure I yeah ignore sunk costs is good advice I think you share my view that many people spend too much reading time reading the literature and sort of end up doing tweaks on tweaks or is that just that I'm lazy which we know you think I am and this is not published fuck it you mean I wrote it in my book that you claim that I'm lazy yes that's so it that's right that's it is a published fact but beyond my laziness I mean I'm always telling my students to be less about the literature and more about life I mean do you agree with that advice or you know I think it's gonna be taken too far but by and large of course I agree with that advice but when you're in the business when you're in the real world you're not in general applying the latest result in you know from psychological science you are you are applying ideas that have been around that have been pre-tested I and I'm interested in the discipline I always was in fact8....
Daniel: I was teaching that seminar in Jerusalem than 40 years ago it's in applying psychology it's not applied psychology it's applying ideas that are out there typically big ideas like the quote Levine's ideas that's what you do and so for that I agree the literature is likely to be somewhat less relevant although you know they're an interesting thing that are happening these days that people can bring them can bring to your can bring to other people's attention that might be relevant by and large most of the good applied work applies ideas that have existed for a long time but I know I've heard you say that the what ends up getting called Applied Psychology is not a part of psychology that has been held in high esteem and is the work of units like this helping or is that an irreconcilable problem I mean in the first place it's a geographic problem and if you've heard me say that Applied Psychology has had a very different standing in the UK and in the US and in the UK applications had always been intellectually respectable much more so than in the US so the unit for Applied Psychology was you know when are the intellectual centers of psychology in in Britain you know 40 years ago thirty years ago and maybe still it in the United States the word applied had a sort of inferior connotation it it lost that temporarily during World War two so major talent flowed into applied work and you got magnificent result that to me the cognitive psychology came on him out of that eventually and many other good things in psychology came from people encountering the real world but by and large the status of Applied Psychology is not high in the United States not nearly as high as it is I think in the UK and it's not an accident that what you're seeing including you know the unit that is organizing this Simula it is not it's not an accident that grew up in London I'm not sure I agree with about that but I think it's largely an accident but now we can argue about that later here's the question from our friend Steven Pinker who's here which is should de biasing be part of the curriculum so should we be explicitly trying to teach people to overcome to the biases that we talked about9....
Daniel: I think it would be good to have in the curriculum something that makes people recognize when they should slow down and reflect them when they're doing run or what they are about to decide we can't reflect all the time and I think teaching about biases is usually not very effective at all but introducing a language to talk about biases educating gossip as I've said that I think could be useful and helping people recognize situations where it is important for them to do the right thing and where they are likely they follow their nature to do the wrong thing teaching people to recognize that is important and today I would because of my interest in noise I think that the recipe for and the prescription for better decision making for better judgement better organized a structured way of thinking is not oriented to particular biases structure in itself can be a good thing and that's not the same as device what was the question that I forgot to ask you thank you well you're not being thinking about what is the next thing that behavioral economics should you that's what you didn't want to answer okay you're good answer that yeah because it's not a matter of recruiting other people it's I think there is an awful lot of decision-making that is going on within firms and in governments and much of it is really a very poor quality it's evolved it hasn't been designed and designing procedures for making better decisions that is a very large field I have called it something the human engineering of decisions just seeing an organization as a factory that produces decisions and then asking what Quality Control can we apply how can we improve the production process for making decisions this I think is a huge and unexplored field and with the increasing prestige of behavioral economics and the willingness to experiment getting into that is I think that is a very big challenge that's where I was in a way resisting you know bringing in new people I would say there is a lot of work for the existing problem because that is not very different from what the existing probably being trained to think about well when we when we try to impose structure though we're gonna run into your another version of your losers problem as you know I've been working....

Richard: With one of the National Football League teams and trying the trying to get the football people to make smarter decisions is really hard like impossible and they strongly resist having somebody else make that for them they think that's you know picking players and deciding whether to go for it on fourth down is not something someone my size should be advising you know of course you're right you're going to encounter this and by the way there are situations in which they're right I mean so I've interacted enough with Gary Klein you know my friend and intellectual adversary to know that the issue of when you do want to trust situation and when you want to control into motion that's not trivial I don't want to eliminate intuition form from decision-making what I would like to do with intuition is delay I would like people to consider a problem before they have an intuition about it they're not after they have an intuition about them now with respect to the amount of opposition that you can expect you can expect a lot of it but that may be because you're impatient I mean you have to think in terms of you know how long how long will it take you to become sort of a famous member of the establishment president of the American Economic Association you didn't start out seemingly going that way took it 25 years and long Moneyball has had an impact it didn't have an immediate impact but it had a substantial impact and I think this kind of thinking is potentially promising I think and could it could take off and don't give up even with the bow players and football teams okay so the following questions you can't blame me for what is your most underappreciated paper and why I know which one you think I don't appreciate it enough but that's true but other people do so that doesn't count Dale isn't here so we won't we don't need to mention it you know I really don't have the feeling that I've been treated badly by the community I don't carry you know that kind of wish for recognition of an ignored paper there are lots of papers of mine that by the way and if it's something that happens with papers that are well-known that some of the best bits in the paper that are well-known are ignored you know people11....
Daniel: Select from your papers and they select what they want and that's not always what I would like this for example of my work I would say take non regressive prediction and base rate neglect that Amos and I put in the same paper not by accident probably I mean my favorite is none number aggressive prediction Amos is favorite clearly was base rate neglect the feel mistaken base rate neglect Nam regressive prediction is still pretty esoteric ideas for many people base rate neglect is much more common that kind of things arbitrary selections from things you have done of course there is a lot of that but you know nobody had the right to be bitter about you know okay here's a here's another question what does the potential and limits of using nudges to increase social capital in developing countries yeah I told you I didn't write this question Danny good all right so here's a different question have you have you soured on your goal your admirable goal about adversarial collaboration are you as pessimistic about that as you are about most things it didn't go very well you know I have that idea that people who have you know the bait should agree to settle things by experimenting by working together there haven't been many takers but interestingly enough the replication crisis is giving a new opportunity for a kind of adversarial collaboration and I've been pushing you know that's one of the main things that I've been interested in in achieving and I haven't really but some things are thinking are happening is that when people replicate somebody else's work they should in effect invite the original author into a collaboration the original author should be involved the original author should criticize the replication the idea that you can that you can replicate somebody's work and then send them the results in the mail for their comment I think that's non collegial I think it is awful behavior and my impression is that the field is going to move that way that replications are going to be collaborative and so that's another version of adversarial collaboration and I have nothing to do with it but I think this is we do yeah so my impression of this recent project is that it was non adversarial in the sense....
Richard: That the lead authors just commissioned sort of independent parties to try to replicate a study and they were told to consult with the original authors and make sure they get their details right and they did I mean if that were the first question I asked because it was not in the original science paper so I wrote Brian Nosek and I asked him what did the authors do and did the authors change their mind you know other 50% within replicated servants and then people I presented some cases and the answer is by and large that they did collaborate I mean the Replicators tried honestly to get through and the fact that they were replicating recent work was very helpful and the authors by and large played by the rules the author's probably didn't say them on so you know you have a finding somebody else fails to replicate it and all of a sudden you get you know those extra 50 and IQ points that you see why it was obvious that there was something wrong with their replication this apparently happened you do yeah one of my favorite condiment Tversky sentences which I ran across recently involves a long term non collaborative adversarial relation you've had over the years and the sentence is that a critique of a caricature can only be a caricature of a critique yeah the term was refutation but yes it's I'm terribly embarrassed about that one that particular sentence that the refutation of a caricature is a caricature of refutation I was very proud of the symptoms except I found that that used it it's a very good sentence I used it twice without being aware it's in to publication of two separate publications one of them less well-known okay I think I've run out of questions you want to answer and we together are preventing everyone here from consuming alcohol these people I will say it's been nice talking to you Thank You Danny well thank you very much to Daniel and thank you also to Richard Taylor handled with aplomb I think exemplifying the idea of adversarial collaboration there actually you exemplified the idea of adversarial collaboration that interview was perfect in the interview yeah exactly well it helps if you're friends now do13....
Richard: You want to stay on the stage you'll get off the stage I don't mind whatever you're okay thank you always good to check Richard I've kind arm well make sure you're happy one final thing I'm not here to borrow I've had a wonderful day and I hope you would all like to join me in showing your appreciation for the staff of a hotel and above all for the staff who organized behavioral exchanges been absolutely wonderful thank you.
