And we do it with very little work and very little effort. Now, there is slow thinking, it's effortful, it's hard work. And it turns out that by and large we clearly - most people are wired to avoid it. We try to do as little as possible of the slow thinking. It's very hard work. And so sometimes when, you know, the fast thinking delivers the wrong suggestion and the slow thinking doesn't block it, then people come out with mistakes."

Dr. Kahneman, you won the Nobel Prize in economics, but you're not an economist; you're a psychologist. From what I understand, that's the first time that's ever happened in that award for economics. To me, that's a confirmation that so much of what is important in economics and in investing has less to do with numbers and spreadsheets and Greek formulas as it does what's going on in our head, and fooling ourselves.",

For a psychologist, that's ridiculous, so what happened next?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, nothing happened immediately but I found that very surprising, actually, because the economics building was next door. I was at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and we had one building and the economists were next door. I learned from that one sentence something I hadn't known before; that they sort of lived in a different intellectual world than we did. For a psychologist it's obvious that people are not fully rational, and that they're not selfish, and that their tastes change. It was just a collection of statements that seemed almost absurd. I had no idea, at that stage, that a lot of my career would be dedicated to that conversation. That sort of happened almost by accident, later."

Our first serious paper appeared in an economics journal, Econometric, in 1979. It appeared there by accident. We were not intending to influence economists. It was the best journal for this sort of theory paper. I think my Nobel was 2002. That is very, very, very quick. They had two Clark medals. You know the Clark medal is really more prestigious than the Nobel in economics. It's given to the best economist under 40, and they had two behavioral ones. Twenty years is very, very fast."

    "question_text": "When psychology was brought into economics, was it fine-tuning around the edges, or was this taking existing theories and turning them upside down?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, it was brought as a series of challenges. The person who really created behavioral economics is Richard Thaler, who is an economist. He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter. The assumptions have been challenged, but economics is still pretty much the same discipline it was."

    "question_text": "Is System 1 my gut and System 2 is my head? Is that a fair way of putting it?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, System 1 is extraordinarily clever. System 1 knows about the world. Your knowledge about the world, all your skills, are in System 1. You drive without paying attention. That's System 1 because you have learned to drive. You maneuver social situations without getting into too much trouble most of the time. That's System 1 and it demands a lot of alertness to cues. The 'gut' -- to say System 1 is the gut -- that suggests that there is no thinking there. The best thinking we do is System 1. Creativity is stuff that comes from your memory. It's in that sense System 1. It doesn't work the way we think it works, but it's not that System 2 is more elevated than System 1. Actually, it's... I don't want to say the reverse, but System 1 is much better at what it does than System 2 is good at what it does.

It makes a lot of sense because when things happen we find their causes, and it's OK. Except that, if you compare our ability to explain the past with our ability to forecast the future, the difference is really quite dramatic. We explain the past with the greatest of ease, and we're really crummy at forecasting the future.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing. But those CFOs don't know it."

There is no improvement. There is some absence of scorekeeping there. On the other hand, there are really many people I think that -- most of us -- have a lot to lose from accurate scorekeeping. That's because of what I said earlier, of our ability for self-delusion, which is really a major asset in our lives. That we can lose. I have given that advice, to keep score and when you make a decision, document the options that you considered but didn't choose. I was giving that advice a lot, and there was one place -- I didn't know it immediately -- somebody took my advice. It was in a financial firm. I won't mention what it was. For a year, he kept track of every decision he made and the options he considered and rejected. There was a fair amount of material collected by the end of the year. Then they told me about it, and we analyzed it. That guy was making well in excess of a million a year, and the conclusion, which I didn't share with anybody, they didn't need him.

And it is actually completely not possible for a finite human mind to be rational or to obey the axioms of rationality. You'd have to know too much. The difficulty of being consistent in all your beliefs is impossible. And if you are not consistent in all your beliefs, you can be trapped in an inconsistency, and then you're not rational.

And I have no doubt — you know, most of my work has been to question intuition, but some people have it. And drivers have it. All of us have it, in many social situations.

And let me elaborate on that sentence. When I ask you about something that you believe in — whether you believe or don’t believe in climate change, or whether you believe in some political position or other — as soon as I raise the question why, you have answers. Reasons come to your mind. But the way that I would see this is that the reasons may have very little to do with the real causes of your beliefs. So the real cause of your belief in a political position, whether conservative or radical left, the real causes are rooted in your personal history. They’re rooted in who are the people that you trusted and what they seemed to believe in, and it has very little to do with the reasons that come to your mind, why your position is correct and the position of the other side is nonsensical.

That's automatic. That System 1 generates stories. It looks for causes, it looks for stories, and it generates its tentative stories that, if endorsed by System 2, become beliefs and opinions. But the speed at which we find explanations for things that happened makes it difficult for us to learn the deep truth. And the deep truth is that the world is much more uncertain than we feel it is.

And the fact that arguments that feel irrefutable come to our mind so easily doesn’t mean that those arguments are the real cause of our beliefs and doesn’t mean much of anything about the validity of the argument. The way that the mind works, very frequently, is that we start from a decision, or we start from a belief, and then the stories that explain it come to our mind. And the sequence that we have, when we think about thinking — that arguments come first and conclusions come later — that sequence is often reversed: conclusions come first, and rationalizations come later."

When I started out in this line of research, I started out as a strong believer that the reality of life is what the experiencing self is. It's what happens as you live. And I thought that's vastly more important than what people think about their life, which, after all, is a construction. And I went about defending the experienced well-being as the more important one. And eventually, I had to change my mind. And I had to change my mind and to conclude that there is no way you can ignore remembering self, or life evaluation, because what people want is not the well-being of their experiencing self. What people want is more closely associated with the remembering self. It's, they want to have good memories. They want to have good opinions of themselves. They want to have a good story about their life."

In one sense, well-being is something that you experience every second of your life: You are more or less happy. You are in a better or worse mood, and you can recall that continuously. And that's the well-being of the experiencing self. But then there is another way of measuring well-being, which is to stop people and to ask them to think about their life and to say whether their life is good or bad. It's completely different. That's the well-being of the remembering self. It's an act of memory and construction, and the two are quite different."

When you cannot imagine an alternative to your belief, you are convinced that your belief is true. That's overconfidence. And overconfidence — whenever there is a war, there were overconfident generals. You can look at failures, and overconfidence had something to do with them. On the other hand, overconfidence, and overconfident optimism, is the engine of capitalism. Entrepreneurs are overconfident. They think they're going to be successful.

And for the life of me, I can't get excited about this question, because when people are raising the issue of whether a robot will be conscious or not, I ask them, how on earth will you know?

But I think it's probably much easier, or, at least, it could be feasible, to train people to detect biases in other people's thinking, because when you are thinking for yourself, you are too busy making the mistake to recognize that you are making a mistake. An observer with less stake in the thinking and less involved in the process of generating the mistake may be more likely to discover it.

And it's true within individuals, but it's especially true among individuals who are supposed to be interchangeable in, say, organizations. I'll tell you where the experiment from which my current fascination with noise arose. I was working with an insurance company, and we did a very standard experiment. They constructed cases, very routine, standard cases. Expensive cases — we're not talking of insuring cars. We're talking of insuring financial firms for risk of fraud. So you have people who are specialists in this. This is what they do. Cases were constructed completely realistically, the kind of thing that people encounter every day. You have 50 people reading a case and putting a dollar value on it. I could ask you, and I asked the executives in the firm, and it's a number that just about everybody agrees. Suppose you take two people at random, two underwriters at random. You average the premium they set, you take the difference between them, and you divide the difference by the average. By what percentage do people differ? Well, would you expect people to differ? And there is a common answer that you find, when I just talk to people and ask them, or the executives had the same answer. It's somewhere around 10 percent. That's what people expect to see in a well-run firm. Now, what we found was 50 percent, 5–0, which, by the way, means that those underwriters were absolutely wasting their time, in the sense of assessing risk. So that's noise, and you find variability across individuals, which is not supposed to exist. And you find variability within individuals, depending morning, afternoon, hot, cold. A lot of things influence the way that people make judgments: whether they are full, or whether they've had lunch or haven't had lunch affects the judges, and things like that. Now, it's hard to say what there is more of, noise or bias. But one thing is very certain — that bias has been overestimated at the expense of noise. Virtually all the literature and a lot of public conversation is about biases. But in fact, noise is, I think, extremely important, very prevalent. There is an interesting fact — that noise and bias are independent sources of error, so that reducing either of them improves overall accuracy. There is room for . . . and the procedures by which you would reduce bias and reduce noise are not the same. So that's what I'm fascinated by these days."

Then having multiple individuals engaged in it, they share their biases, you'll get the bias. It's going to be worsened, and everybody will have much higher confidence in their biased views because other people share them. So wisdom of the crowd works under quite specified conditions. With respect to the underwriters, I would expect, certainly, that if you took 12 underwriters assessing the same risk, you would eliminate the noise. You would be left with bias, but you would eliminate one source of error, and the question is just price. Google, for example, when it hires people, they have a minimum of four individuals making independent assessments of each candidate.

Delaying intuition until the facts are in, at hand, and looking at dimensions of the problem separately and independently is a better use of information. The problem with intuition is that it forms very quickly, so that you need to have special procedures in place to control it except in those rare cases — and Gary Klein and others have demonstrated that — where you have intuitive expertise. That's true for athletes — they respond intuitively. It's true for chess masters. It's true for firefighters, captains, as Gary Klein has shown. So that's intuitive expertise. I don't think CEOs encounter many problems where they have intuitive expertise. They haven't had the opportunity to acquire it, so they better slow down."

That's fundamentally what he has shown, and he really knows why, or he knows how they do it. And the tricks are very simple. If you made a list of intelligent ways to go at problems, that's what people do. They view the problem as an instance of a category, and then they switch to looking at the problem from the inside. Essentially, they adopt different points of view. It's not the same thing as what I was saying earlier about breaking up a problem into dimensions and averaging. There's no averaging, but there is looking at a problem from multiple dimensions and collecting a lot of information. And that's basically what creates superforecasters."

It will make them more appealing to others, they will get more resources, and they will take risks. It's not necessarily good for them.

And it was true for a while. It is true no longer. The programs do not need the grand masters. You know how it happened, and it's likely to happen in many other fields. It's happening in dermatology. The diagnosis is now better done by programs than by people, and they are not going to need the person very often.

Gary Klein and I became friends over a period of six years when we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? I'm sort of a critic of intuition, and he is very much in favor of intuition, of expert intuition. And we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? Because it's clear that sometimes intuition is wonderful and sometimes it's awful. We ended up with a fairly obvious set of conclusions about what it is. You're going to have Gary Klein–type intuition, expert intuition, if you have a regular world. That's condition number one. There are regularities that you can pick up.

    "summarised_context": "Tyler has moved the conversation back to methodological issues in psychology, following up on his earlier question about replication and the System 1/System 2 framework. Now he's probing the historical timeline of the replication crisis itself, asking why it took so long to emerge in social psychology. This reflects Tyler's interest in understanding institutional dynamics and the sociology of scientific progress - not just the content of research, but the processes by which scientific fields self-correct and evolve.",
    "question_text": "Why did the replication crisis take so long to arrive in social psychology?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, I would question that. It didn't take very long. The replication crisis was studied first in medicine, where there were provocative claims by Stanford. I don't know . . . he's not a statistician, is he? There were provocative claims that most published research in medicine are false, and it started there. Then psychology came very soon after. In fact, psychology was considered to have been quite rapid in adopting it. There was a crisis, and many results were questioned, I think correctly. There were aggressors, and there were defenders, and both sides, I think, behaved, quite often, quite badly. It's amazing — within a decade, psychology has changed. Many areas of psychology have changed, and it clearly is a better science than it was 10 years ago because of the replication crisis."

    "summarised_context": "The audience Q&A continues with a forward-looking question about technology's impact on human cognition. An audience member is asking about bounded rationality in the digital age, specifically whether easy access to information (like price comparisons on Amazon) is making people more or less susceptible to biases over the past 20-30 years. This reflects contemporary concerns about how technological change intersects with fundamental human psychology, touching on both the opportunities and risks of information abundance.",
    "question_text": "I have a question about bounded rationality over time. With the rise of the internet, the rise of more readily available information — so many prices, things you can see on Amazon — all this price discrimination and differentiation across products has grown with that. Do you think that people's biases are improving or getting worse over time as more information, for example, over the past 20, 30 years, has become more readily available?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "To the extent that you think of biases as representing human nature in a broad cultural context, it hasn't changed over the last 30 years. Human nature hasn't changed. In certain domains, it's much easier to be rational when you can look things up, when you can search on the computer instead of going out and searching, as you had to when I was a young person. Then, of course, you can achieve more rational results than you could. But whether it has changed anything significant, I doubt it. And what is very striking over the last few years is that it's not only information that is readily available. Misinformation is also readily available. So the net effect . . . It used to be very clear that this is all to the good, but what we're seeing in the last few years is that there is a very heavy cost to the availability and the ease of expression that transmits itself over the internet."

    "summarised_context": "The audience Q&A continues with an urgent contemporary question about practical applications of psychological insights to major social problems. An audience member is asking whether behavioral economics can offer solutions to political polarization - one of the most pressing challenges of the current era. This reflects the expectation that cognitive science should provide tools for addressing societal divisions, while also testing the limits of what academic insights can accomplish when applied to large-scale social phenomena.",
    "question_text": "How can we use behavioral economics to reduce political polarization?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "It's not that I have an answer and I'm suppressing it. Here is a topic where I am optimistic, but I have no idea. I don't have an answer. But I think the kind of thinking that is going on, where you're trying to look at practical manipulations — the word manipulation is a bad word, but I intend it as a good thing — when you look at the practical moves that can make a difference in the way that people think, that way of thinking should be effective in improving the quality of life and improving the quality . . . How polarization can be reduced is too big a problem for me and, I think, currently for behavioral economics."

A questioner representing high school psychology students is asking for concrete advice about applying Kahneman's research to major life decisions like college and career choices. This represents the common expectation that psychological insights should translate into actionable guidance for individual decision-making, providing Kahneman an opportunity to clarify the limits of what his research can and cannot offer for personal choices.",
    "question_text": "On a practical note, my high school psychology students ask how they can best use your research to make choices about college and career.",
    "true_kahneman_response": "My research adds absolutely nothing to this. There are sensible ways of choosing colleges, and I think they're well known. You have to collect a lot of information, and you have to ask yourself what the student really wants and where he or she will really fit. There are obvious ways of doing this. I have nothing to add, I think."

    "summarised_context": "The audience Q&A has returned to foundational theoretical questions about behavioral economics. An audience member is probing Kahneman's critique of using neoclassical rationality as a normative benchmark, referencing his preference for 'reasonableness' over 'rationality' as a standard. This sophisticated question pushes into the philosophical foundations of economic modeling and asks Kahneman to articulate what alternative normative frameworks might look like that better account for human nature and psychological realities.",
    "question_text": "Many behavioral economists use the notion of rationality in neoclassical economics as a normative benchmark, and you have said that you don't think that's necessarily a good normative benchmark. Instead, something like reasonableness is a better way to think about those things. Could you say more about how we might identify, or define and identify, this reasonableness?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "The rational-agent models are built on the notion of consistency being the one guiding principle. Your beliefs and your preferences have to be internally consistent. Nobody can tell you what to believe, nobody can tell you what you want. The only thing we know is that you ought to be consistent. Otherwise you're not rational. As a normative principle — that consistency is the only normative principle — that strikes me as pretty odd. There are other things that seem to matter. There is human nature, and human nature is not consistent. We are context dependent, so our emotions are context dependent. We ought to have normative theories that are adapted to who we are as people, as humans. And the idea of consistency — it's completely infeasible for a finite mind, and we have finite minds. So on that ground alone, it would be questionable as the principle for a normative model. But in addition, one would want a normative theory that takes into account human nature, which the principle of consistency doesn't."
