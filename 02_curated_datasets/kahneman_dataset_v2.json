And we do it with very little work and very little effort.\n\nNow, there is slow thinking, it's effortful, it's hard work. And it turns out that by and large we clearly - most people are wired to avoid it. We try to do as little as possible of the slow thinking. It's very hard work.\n\nAnd so sometimes when, you know, the fast thinking delivers the wrong suggestion and the slow thinking doesn't block it, then people come out with mistakes."

Dr. Kahneman, you won the Nobel Prize in economics, but you're not an economist; you're a psychologist. From what I understand, that's the first time that's ever happened in that award for economics. To me, that's a confirmation that so much of what is important in economics and in investing has less to do with numbers and spreadsheets and Greek formulas as it does what's going on in our head, and fooling ourselves.",

For a psychologist, that's ridiculous, so what happened next?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, nothing happened immediately but I found that very surprising, actually, because the economics building was next door. I was at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and we had one building and the economists were next door. I learned from that one sentence something I hadn't known before; that they sort of lived in a different intellectual world than we did.\n\nFor a psychologist it's obvious that people are not fully rational, and that they're not selfish, and that their tastes change. It was just a collection of statements that seemed almost absurd. I had no idea, at that stage, that a lot of my career would be dedicated to that conversation. That sort of happened almost by accident, later."

It was the best journal for this sort of theory paper.\n\nI think my Nobel was 2002. That is very, very, very quick. They had two Clark medals. You know the Clark medal is really more prestigious than the Nobel in economics. It's given to the best economist under 40, and they had two behavioral ones. Twenty years is very, very fast."

    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, it was brought as a series of challenges. The person who really created behavioral economics is Richard Thaler, who is an economist. He happened -- not \"happened,\" it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student.\n\nHe is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career.\n\nIn the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called \"Anomalies\" and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory.\n\nThese columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable.\n\nWe didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described.\n\nHe has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have \"bounded self-control,\" as he describes it. They have procrastination problems.\n\nThey don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter.\n\nThe assumptions have been challenged, but economics is still pretty much the same discipline it was."

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one.\n\nThinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made.\n\nIn the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes.\n\nThere is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts.\n\nOne of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year.\n\nIn the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea.\n\nThe thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised.\n\nIn fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow.\n\nLet me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that.\n\nThe correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.\n\nThat's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing. But those CFOs don't know it."

That's because of what I said earlier, of our ability for self-delusion, which is really a major asset in our lives. That we can lose.\n\nI have given that advice, to keep score and when you make a decision, document the options that you considered but didn't choose. I was giving that advice a lot, and there was one place -- I didn't know it immediately -- somebody took my advice.\n\nIt was in a financial firm. I won't mention what it was. For a year, he kept track of every decision he made and the options he considered and rejected. There was a fair amount of material collected by the end of the year.\n\nThen they told me about it, and we analyzed it. That guy was making well in excess of a million a year, and the conclusion, which I didn't share with anybody, they didn't need him. They could have saved a million dollars. He was adding nothing.\n\nThat's the kind of thing that people expose themselves to when they keep score.

    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, it's the only thing we know. That is, effort and attention are very closely related to consciousness; so what you're conscious of, what you're aware of. And with System 2, when you multiply 17 by 24 in your head, or even not in your head, you're operating in sequence. And you are aware of the sequence, so you are aware of your thinking. But in System 1, you're not aware of the thinking. This is one of the definitions of intuition: It is that it's knowing something without knowing why you know it. And I have no doubt — you know, most of my work has been to question intuition, but some people have it. And drivers have it. All of us have it, in many social situations. So we become skilled, and when we are skilled, what used to be effortful and System 2 becomes automatic and System 1."

So that’s one thing, one remark I wanted to make.\n\nA completely different one, which occurs to me because you mentioned politics, is that one of the important realizations that come from thinking of the world in terms of System 1 and System 2 is that our beliefs do not come from where we think they came. And let me elaborate on that sentence. When I ask you about something that you believe in — whether you believe or don’t believe in climate change, or whether you believe in some political position or other — as soon as I raise the question why, you have answers. Reasons come to your mind. But the way that I would see this is that the reasons may have very little to do with the real causes of your beliefs.\n\nSo the real cause of your belief in a political position, whether conservative or radical left, the real causes are rooted in your personal history. They’re rooted in who are the people that you trusted and what they seemed to believe in, and it has very little to do with the reasons that come to your mind, why your position is correct and the position of the other side is nonsensical. And we take the reasons that people give for their actions and beliefs, and our own reasons for our actions and beliefs, much too seriously.\n\nTippett:Right, and we duel with them, and we’re not actually talking about —"

That's automatic. That System 1 generates stories. It looks for causes, it looks for stories, and it generates its tentative stories that, if endorsed by System 2, become beliefs and opinions. But the speed at which we find explanations for things that happened makes it difficult for us to learn the deep truth. And the deep truth is that the world is much more uncertain than we feel it is. We see a version of the world that is simplified and just a lot simpler and a lot more certain than the world really is. So that's the way I would talk about it."

When you cannot imagine an alternative to your belief, you are convinced that your belief is true. That’s overconfidence.

But I think it’s probably much easier, or, at least, it could be feasible, to train people to detect biases in other people’s thinking, because when you are thinking for yourself, you are too busy making the mistake to recognize that you are making a mistake. An observer with less stake in the thinking and less involved in the process of generating the mistake may be more likely to discover it.

    "true_kahneman_response": "I’ll tell you where the experiment from which my current fascination with noise arose. I was working with an insurance company, and we did a very standard experiment. They constructed cases, very routine, standard cases. Expensive cases — we’re not talking of insuring cars. We’re talking of insuring financial firms for risk of fraud.\n\nSo you have people who are specialists in this. This is what they do. Cases were constructed completely realistically, the kind of thing that people encounter every day. You have 50 people reading a case and putting a dollar value on it.\n\nI could ask you, and I asked the executives in the firm, and it’s a number that just about everybody agrees. Suppose you take two people at random, two underwriters at random. You average the premium they set, you take the difference between them, and you divide the difference by the average.\n\nBy what percentage do people differ? Well, would you expect people to differ? And there is a common answer that you find, when I just talk to people and ask them, or the executives had the same answer. It’s somewhere around 10 percent. That’s what people expect to see in a well-run firm.\n\nNow, what we found was 50 percent, 5–0, which, by the way, means that those underwriters were absolutely wasting their time, in the sense of assessing risk. So that’s noise, and you find variability across individuals, which is not supposed to exist.\n\nAnd you find variability within individuals, depending morning, afternoon, hot, cold. A lot of things influence the way that people make judgments: whether they are full, or whether they’ve had lunch or haven’t had lunch affects the judges, and things like that.\n\nNow, it’s hard to say what there is more of, noise or bias. But one thing is very certain — that bias has been overestimated at the expense of noise. Virtually all the literature and a lot of public conversation is about biases. But in fact, noise is, I think, extremely important, very prevalent.\n\nThere is an interesting fact — that noise and bias are independent sources of error, so that reducing either of them improves overall accuracy. There is room for . . . and the procedures by which you would reduce bias and reduce noise are not the same. So that’s what I’m fascinated by these days."

Delaying intuition until the facts are in, at hand, and looking at dimensions of the problem separately and independently is a better use of information. The problem with intuition is that it forms very quickly, so that you need to have special procedures in place to control it except in those rare cases — and Gary Klein and others have demonstrated that — where you have intuitive expertise. That's true for athletes — they respond intuitively. It's true for chess masters. It's true for firefighters, captains, as Gary Klein has shown. So that's intuitive expertise.

Because I've read conflicting theories there. So the moral emotion of shame and your thoughts. And two, what is the impact of counterfactual thinking on happiness in your study?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "About shame, I really have no idea. It’s there. Should one wish that it weren’t? It’s probably a force that induces better behavior in lots of people who would not be controlled in other ways. So I don’t know how important or how useful it is. It’s painful to the people who feel it, and it might be useful to others who might be affected by bad behavior.\n\nAs for counterfactuals and happiness, I think that what you referred to — there are counterfactual emotions. Regret is a counterfactual emotion. Guilt is a counterfactual emotion. You can ask in the sense that they are driven by something that didn’t happen, that could have happened but didn’t.\n\nSome of these emotions seem to be completely superfluous, like regret. And I think people, by and large, would be better off without regret. But notice what regret is. Regret is what happens the next morning. And if we didn’t have it, then who knows what we might do.\n\n[laughter]"

On this topic of delaying intuition — and I'm delighted that Mr. Klein is in the audience because I spent over a decade myself as an intuitive expert and found myself mostly using recognition-primed decision-making. I'm curious how much you think availability bias, confirmation bias, et cetera, was still affecting my recognition-primed decision-making. And is recognition-primed decision-making still useful? Or is it just the best option in a temporally constrained environment?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "I think, obviously, recognition-primed decision-making is going to be wonderful if people really can recognize things accurately. If they can diagnose the situation accurately and do it quickly and act intuitively on that basis, then of course it’s beneficial. And there are conditions under which this applies.\n\nGary Klein and I became friends over a period of six years when we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? I’m sort of a critic of intuition, and he is very much in favor of intuition, of expert intuition. And we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? Because it’s clear that sometimes intuition is wonderful and sometimes it’s awful.\n\nWe ended up with a fairly obvious set of conclusions about what it is. You’re going to have Gary Klein–type intuition, expert intuition, if you have a regular world. That’s condition number one. There are regularities that you can pick up. And if you have a lot of experience and if the feedback is rapid and unequivocal.\n\nIf you have those three conditions, which are true for chess players — and they’re true for spouses recognizing the emotion of their spouse on the telephone, to give you a completely different example — then intuition will develop and it will be perfect. If those conditions do not develop, I don’t think we can trust people who say that they’re experts."

I know that Israel afforded many opportunities when I was growing up, and it probably still does. I grew up very early in the history of Israel, when the state was small and everyone could make a difference. And you really could make a difference. I was, as a lieutenant in the army, age 21 or 22 — I made a difference. I created an interviewing system for the whole army.\n\nThose kinds of experiences — that you can do things that seemed impossible or unlikely — that is certainly very liberating and encouraging and induces creativity.\n\nI think some of that is actually present now that the state is bigger and more established. I was telling you earlier how my grandson is in the Israeli army — the kinds of experiences that he has as a sergeant. He feels very free in an intelligence unit. He feels that he can use his mind and that he can speak his mind, and it’s going to be wonderful for his future."

I don’t know . . . he’s not a statistician, is he? There were provocative claims that most published research in medicine are false, and it started there.\n\nThen psychology came very soon after. In fact, psychology was considered to have been quite rapid in adopting it. There was a crisis, and many results were questioned, I think correctly. There were aggressors, and there were defenders, and both sides, I think, behaved, quite often, quite badly.\n\nIt’s amazing — within a decade, psychology has changed.

Human nature hasn’t changed.\n\nIn certain domains, it’s much easier to be rational when you can look things up, when you can search on the computer instead of going out and searching, as you had to when I was a young person. Then, of course, you can achieve more rational results than you could. But whether it has changed anything significant, I doubt it.\n\nAnd what is very striking over the last few years is that it’s not only information that is readily available. Misinformation is also readily available. So the net effect . . . It used to be very clear that this is all to the good, but what we’re seeing in the last few years is that there is a very heavy cost to the availability and the ease of expression that transmits itself over the internet."

As a normative principle — that consistency is the only normative principle — that strikes me as pretty odd.\n\nThere are other things that seem to matter. There is human nature, and human nature is not consistent. We are context dependent, so our emotions are context dependent. We ought to have normative theories that are adapted to who we are as people, as humans.\n\nAnd the idea of consistency — it’s completely infeasible for a finite mind, and we have finite minds.

But later, when we did more research, it turned out that the circumstances that make people happy and the circumstances that make them satisfied with their life are not the same.\n\nSo happiness is mostly social. It's, you know, it's being with people you love who love you back. That's that's a lot of what happiness is. Life satisfaction is much more conventional - it's to be successful. And, you know, so it's money, education, prestige, that sort of thing is what satisfaction is about. So those are two very different things. I thought that satisfaction is irrelevant. You know, that's how I began.\n\nAnd we have a research program where we were trying to, you know, to show that this is the case. But then after a few years, I realized that what people really want in their life is they don't seem to care about how happy they'll be. They seem to want to be satisfied with their life. They seem to want to have a good story about their life.

I've always thought that this is the best psychological idea ever. You know, so far as I'm concerned. But it's that when you want somebody to move from A to B in terms of their behavior, you can think of it that there are two ways of doing it. You can push them or you can ask the question, why aren't they doing B already?\n\nWhich is an unusual question that you want. So then when you ask why, why not? Why aren't they doing B they ought to? I think they ought to. Then you get a list of restraining forces. That was Kurt Lewin, the psychologist and that's my guru and that's my hero. And what he spoke of was restraining forces. I mean, so there are reasons why they're not where you want them to be. So he spoke of behavior as an equilibrium, the forces of pushing you one way forces that are pushing you the other way.\n\nSo how loud you speak, how fast you drive? It's easy to think of it as an equilibrium. And what we tend to do when we want to move people from A to B is we push them. We add to the driving forces and Lewin's insight was that this is not what you should do, you should actually work on the restraining forces and try to make them weaker. And that's a beautiful point. And he showed he had that image that, you know, I've had since I was an undergraduate.\n\nAnd I'm not sure actually whether it was his image or something that I drew from reading him. But it's like you have the plank and it's being held by two sets of springs. You know, you wanted to move one direction and so you could add another string that would push it that way. Or you could remove one of the springs that are holding it back. And the interesting thing, and that's the striking outcome is when it moves, if it moves because of the driving force you've added to the driving force, then at equilibrium it will be in a higher state of tension than it was originally.\n\nThat is because you've compressed a spring and it's pushing back harder. But if you remove a restraining force at equilibrium, there would be less tension in the system. I must have been 20 years old. I thought that's just so beautiful."

Behaviors don't necessarily reflect the personality, but behaviors have a lot to do with the situation. And so if people behave in strange ways, look at the situation there and what are the pressures in the situation that make them this way.\n\nSo there is a bias that the social psychologists... social psychologists call the fundamental attribution error. And that means that when you see people acting in some way, you think that it's because of their personality that they do. It may not be the case. It's quite likely that the situation is making them do. I'd like people to know that motivation is complex and that people do good things for a mixture of good and bad reasons, and they do bad things through a mixture of good and bad reasons.\n\nAnd I think that if there is a point to educating people in psychology is to make them less judgmental, just have more empathy and more patience.

When it's your friend, you're thinking of all the things that that your friend could do.\n\nBut when it's you, you're thinking of all the things that you'd have to do.\n\nAnd giving up things that you have is much more difficult than not getting things that you could have. So the things that you have to give up loom much larger than the things that you could get. And that's a very different computation.\n\nAnd that, that explains why when you're advising your friend, you're thinking of the benefits, but when you're in the situation, you're thinking of the costs. And that's, I think, that's the main reason that we have trouble. Another reason is, you know, you have a particular perspective when you're inside the problem, and you see all the obstacles, and you just see them more clearly than you can see them from outside. So loss aversion is probably the main factor, but that, that inside versus outside perspective is also significant.\n\nIn fact, you know, what I've said about situations also applies to governments and policy. Most of the time when we have a problem, there is a solution. You know, there's usually the solution is that somebody has to lose. The problem is that the losers are very articulate and the winners are not yet born or they're not yet, you know, they're not yet organized. You want to change policy, usually what it amounts to is that you want to, you know, those who are currently winning are no longer going to be winning. And they're just not going to, they're not going to accept that lying down. So that's again, is endowment. We have it. The losses are much harder to accept than the gains that we're going to get."

And so if I'm... correct me if I'm getting this wrong. So it's sort of like a stable environment, repeated attempts and rapid feedback. It strikes me that most decisions made in organizations do not fit that environment. And yet we're making a lot of these decisions on judgment or experience. What are the ways that we can sort of make better decisions with that in the context?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, in the first place, I think, you know, you shouldn't expect too much. I talk to lower expectations. You should have low expectations about improving the systems. I mean, there is one basic rule is slow down, especially if you if you have the immediate conviction, slow down. There are procedures. You know, there are ways of reaching better, better decisions, but reaching better judgments. And we can talk about them.\n\nI would love to... if you really want to improve the quality of decision making, use algorithms wherever you can. If you can replace judgments by by rules and algorithms, they'll do better. There are big social costs to trusting, allowing algorithms to make decisions. But the decisions are likely to be better. So that's what if you can't use the algorithms, then you slow yourself down. And then there are things that you can do for certain types of problems and different types of problems.\n\nSo one class of problems - forecasting problems. My friend, Phil Tetlock, has that book, Super Forecasters, where he identifies people who are good at forecasting the future, but they do... what that makes them good and and tries to train people and they can improve. So that's one classic problem.\n\nI'm into another kind of problem, judgment problems, where basically you're considering options or you're evaluating the situation and you're trying to give it a score. There, there is advice, I think, on how to do it. For me, it goes back to something I did in the Israeli army when I was like 22 years old. So that's a long time ago. Like 63 years ago, I was a psychologist in the Israeli army and I was assigned the job of setting up an interviewing system for the army.\n\nThat was ridiculous that, you know, this was the beginning of the state of Israel. So people were improvising all over the place. I had a B.A. and I think I was the best trained psychologist in the army... my boss was a chemist. Brilliant. But anyway, and the existing system was one where people would interview and try to form an intuitive global image of how well that recruit would do as a combat soldier. That was the objective of the interview.\n\nAnd because I had read a book, I mean, I took a different tack and the different tack was I identified six traits that I sort of made up. And I had them ask questions and evaluate each of these traits independently and score it and write down the score, then go on to the next trait. And they had to do it for all six traits. That was that's all I asked them to do. And the interviewers who... who were younger than I am, the recruits, but very, very smart, selected for being good.\n\nAnd they were furious with me and they were furious with me because they wanted to exercise their intuition. And I said, remember that one of them said, you are turning us into robots. So I compromised with them. And I said, OK, could you do it my way? And I told them, you try to be reliable, not valid. You know, I'm in charge of validity, you be reliable, which was pretty arrogant, but that's that's how I presented it.\n\nBut then when you're done, close your eyes and just put down a number of how good a soldier is that person likely to be. And when we validated the results of the interview, it was a big improvement over what had gone on before. But the other surprise was that the final intuitive judgments... it was good, it was as good as the average of the six traits and not the same, it added information. So actually we ended up with a score that was half was determined by the specific ratings and the intuition was half the weight.\n\nAnd that, by the way, stayed in the Israeli army for well over 50 years. I don't know whether I think it probably some version of it is still in force. But around 15 years ago, I visited my old base and the commanding officer of the research unit was telling me how they run the interview. And then she said, and then we tell them, close your eyes. So that that had stayed for 50 years, not just the close your eyes. And that whole idea is now the basis of the book that I'm writing.\n\nSo I actually have the same idea, really, that when you are making decisions, you should think of options as if they were candidates. So you should break it up into dimensions, evaluate each dimension separately, then look at the profile. And the key is delay your intuition. Don't try to form an intuition quickly, which is what we normally do. Focus on the separate points. And then when you have the whole profile, then you can have an intuition and it's going to be better because people form intuitions too quickly and the rapid intuitions are not particularly good.\n\nSo if you delay intuition until you have more information, it's going to be better."

    "true_kahneman_response": "It's a bit hard to separate. In judgment, this is what you do when you integrate a lot of information informally into a score of some kind. We speak, we being my co-authors in the book we're writing, we speak of judgment as measurements, but it's measurement where the measuring instrument is your mind.\n\nBut you do it informally. And because you do it informally, people are going to... are not necessarily going to agree. So wherever we say it's a matter for judgment, we're allowing for differences, for variability. Now, judgment can be more or less slow, more or less systematic. So at one end, you have your intuition where you allow the judgment to go very quickly and so on. And at the other end, you try to delay intuition.\n\nBut ultimately, if you're making it by judgment, you're going to have a judgment and it's going to be like an intuition and you're going to go with it. So there's more or less deliberate judgment, but intuition is always involved at one point or another."

    "question_text": "Are there particular biases that if people could just be aware of them, they would make better decisions?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "I really think that's not very helpful because there are so many biases and the biases work in different directions anyway. So sometimes you can recognize a situation as one in which, you know, you're likely to be wrong in a particular way. So that's like illusions. If you if you recognize a particular pattern of something that gives rise to visual illusion, then you don't trust your eyes. You know, you do something else. And the same thing happens when you recognize this is a situation where I'm likely to make an error.\n\nSo sometimes you can recognize the importance, for example, of what we've called an anchor. So you're going to negotiate a price with somebody. They start very high and that has an effect. So, you know, or you should know the person who moves first and the negotiation has an advantage. Because it's the first number that changes everybody's view of what is considered plausible to move things in that direction. That's that's a phenomenon. People can learn that and they can learn to resist it.\n\nSo when I was teaching negotiations, I would say if somebody does that to you, comes up with a number, that's absurd. I would say lose your temper, make a scene, say I will not start the conversation from that number. It's an absurd number. I don't want to talk about the rest of them. So that's something that they, you know, you can improve if you recognize.\n\nI think people are aware of the fact that you shouldn't make a decision about road safety within a short interval of a terrible accident. And so you should allow things to settle down and cool down. There is a more subtle error and it's harder harder to fix, but the best prediction, the best guess is always less extreme than your impression. Intuitive prediction is, as we say, not regressive. It doesn't recognize the regression to the mean, but statistics is statistics and statistically, things are less extreme."

    "true_kahneman_response": "I have been unable to think of a better one, but the story is about Julie. That's part of the story. That's her name. She is a graduating senior at university. And I'll tell you one fact about her that she read fluently when she was four. What's her GPA?\n\nAnd the interesting thing here is that everybody has a number. As soon as I told you that fact, a number came to mind. Now we know where that number came from. We really... that's one of the few things that I'm reasonably sure I understand perfectly. And this is that when you hear she read fluently at age four, you get an impression of how precocious she was. That's impressive. And you could put that in percentiles, you know, whether that put her on a percentile for sort of aptitude ability and it's high, it's not, you know, if you read fluently at age two and a half would be more extreme, but it falls pretty high. So said the 90th percentile. And then the GPA that comes to your mind is around the 90th percentile in the distribution of GPA. So you pick something. Your prediction is as extreme as your impression.\n\nMm hmm. And it's idiotic, statistically completely stupid, because clearly the age at which I learn to read is not all that diagnostic with respect to GPA. So it's better than nothing if you didn't know anything, you would predict the mean GPA, whatever they did, three point one, three point two. Now she's bright, so probably a little higher, but not three point seven. You don't want to. So that's cool. That's a bias.\n\nThat's not regressive prediction. And that's very hard to resist. Sometimes I'm able to resist it, but never when it's important. You know, when I'm really involved in something, I don't think about it. But sometimes I will recommend, oh, you know, that's a situation I should moderate my prediction. And if you're conscious of it, that's an example of one. You can sort of talk yourself."

And this is that when you are about to make a decision, a group. Not quite, because if you've made it, it's too late, but they're approaching you. And then you get people in the room who can be the people who are making the decision. And you say suppose it's two years from now we made the decision that we're contemplating and it turned out to be a disaster. Now we have a page in front of you write the history of the disaster, and that's the premortem. And and it's beautiful as an idea.\n\nIt's beautiful because when people are coming close to a decision, it becomes difficult to raise doubts or to raise questions. People who are following the group down when the group is nearing a decision are perceived as really, you know, and really, you know this. They want to get rid of them. And the premortem legitimises that sort of dissent and that sort of. Not only legitimizes that, but rewards it, and so that's a very good idea.\n\nI don't you know, I don't think that it's going to prevent people from making mistakes, big mistakes. But it could certainly it will allow people to identify possible loopholes to to things that they ought to do to make it safer. So that's a that's a good procedure. And there are many others. What comes to mind? What comes to mind is, is to make intelligence and the collection of information independent of the decision makers wishes. And you really want to protect the independence of the people collecting the evidence.\n\nAnd I would add to the procedures, really, people don't like that if it were possible to implement it, I think would be good. And that's. Look, when you are going to be discussing the topic and it's known in advance and people in central material to think about the topic that you may want them to write down their decision, the decision they are in favor of before the discussion starts, that has many advantages. It's going to give you a broader diversity of points of view because people tend to converge very quickly in a in a group discussion and it forces people to be better prepared.\n\nSo it's except people don't want this. So I don't know whether it's even possible to implement. But clearly, if you could be a good idea."

So you when an investment is being discussed, so by the investment firm, some staff people, if it's a big investment stuff, people will prepare a briefing book with chapters. Now, our recommendation would be that the staff should end each chapter with a score.\n\nHow does that chapter, taken on its own, independently of anything else, affect the likely decision? And then you could structure the meeting, the discussions and the meeting of the boards to discuss these schools.

But it led to a problem and they started having the first person who — who reviewed the application, put their review number on the corner like they would actually put their rating on the page and then hand it off to the second person.

And the Admissions Committee used to operate in what we consider the correct manner, and that is everybody would individually make their judgments and then they would reveal all judgments together and average them. But they change the system so that now people spoke in sequence.\n\nAnd the question was asked, why do you do this? This is not optimum. And they say, \"Well, we used to do it the other way. We used to have people prepare their judgments individually, but there was so much disagreement that we stopped.\"\n\nAnd that's an example where people manage to avoid finding out how much noise there really is because when the — when people are allowed to influence each other or influence themselves, in the case of the teacher reading multiple booklets, when — when judgments are not independent, they are less effective statistically. You just have less information.\n\nThink of the example in which the first person to talk is the CEO and then everybody agrees. Then the agreement of other people is not informative. In fact, you had one person making the judgment. That's the extreme of abolishing — of eliminating the appearance of noise without eliminating the reality of them."

We just assume noise away.\n\nWe saw that but very nicely among underwriters. You know, when you interview an underwriter, what happens to them? But how does an underwriter become expert in the absence of any feedback because they don't — they don't get any feedback from reality about their underwriting. And what happens is that they become increasingly confident and largely because they agree with themselves.\n\nSo when you agree with yourself a lot and you think you are right, and you make judgments with increasing speed and confidence so that makes you think that you're even greater, that's naive realism allowing massive noise to occur with everybody convinced that they are doing the right thing but, in fact, they may not be doing the right thing because if they were looking at the same problem, that would be different."

    "question_text": "There was one section I was fascinated by where you discussed hiring and promotions and how — I don't want to use the word \"random,\" but how much noise is in that system and how unreliable many organizations' hiring processes are. Tell us a little bit about that.",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, it turns out that people like hiring, interviewing people and — and, for me, general image of the individual that they are thinking of hiring. And it turns out this is not a good way of doing it. A much better way of doing it is what is called a structured interview or a structured process where you accumulate information systematically about different characteristics of the person.\n\nThat is less pleasant. It's — it's less enjoyable, but much better. And better yet is having several — several people do the hiring, each of them forming an independent impression and then they discuss — then they average and then they discuss the average. And it's about state of the art, but many places are way short of state of the art.\n\nI should add that state of the art hiring doesn't mean that you're guaranteed a perfect fit. There is so much — there is so much luck in the world, there is so much uncertainty that the person that you hire may be very good, that they run into difficulties with — with the boss doesn't like her or something like that. And by chance alone, you can get a lot of variety.\n\nChance, by the way, is not noise. Chance is something that happens in the real-world. Noise is differences among judgments.\n\nSo, hiring is, by and large, really very poorly done. And it's very poorly done because it doesn't control noise."

And, you know, the word is not particularly appealing, but it's intended to bring to mind the image of washing your hands.\n\nAnd there is a contrast between debiasing (ph) and decision hygiene. Debiasing is like medication or like vaccination, it's specific to a particular disease. When you wash your hands, you don't know what germs you're killing. And if you're successful, you'll never know.\n\nSo, decision hygiene is oriented to improving decision-making and avoiding errors, specifically, avoiding noise, but incidentally also avoiding bias without knowing precisely what biases you're trying to control. And we have a variety of procedures that we think of as decision hygiene."

So, suppose you are making a decision and the first step everyone will tell you is you have to consider your options and have the best possible set of options.\n\nBut now you come to evaluate options, how do you do that? And here actually, our advice, we have a slogan. We say options are like candidates. You should think of options in the same way that the organizations are in — are advised to operate when they hire candidates. And we were talking about that earlier. Structure the thinking, break up the — each options, look at the various aspects of it, make — assess these aspects in a fact-based way, which is the equivalent of interviewing somebody about this aspects or character or — or experience. And then create a profile of old information you have about that option, and only then invoke intuition.\n\nSo, there's a key principle of decision hygiene. It is not to avoid intuition all together, but to delay it because intuition is way more effective if it is preceded by a period in which it will accumulate information systematically. So that's an example."

So, we haven't found places that control noise very efficiently.\n\nThe only way, by the way, to get rid of the noise — and that's really quite important — is average judgments.

I recognized this in myself. I was about to take a flight to France when there were just a hundred cases in France; that didn't look like much, except it was doubling every couple of days. And that was really quite powerful.\n\nWhat we've seen since is that people think about risk a lot, but it doesn't look as if we have a very explicit idea of what those risks are. And I've been struck by the role of emotion, which I hadn't emphasized in my previous work. Some people are very afraid and other people are much less afraid, and it's the level of fear that seems to dominate behavior. You have people who have barely gone out over the two years and other people who have exploited every opening and every opportunity. And that looks more like a different emotional response than a different risk calculation, because we haven't had much material to really make calculations."

    "question_text": "You mentioned that \"there is huge variability among judges in terms of the sentences they are imposing for the same offenses. And yet judges really do not want to be made to be uniform. It seems to strike very deeply—the possibility of enforcing or even suggesting that uniformity is desirable is already quite threatening.\" What do you think is driving that reaction?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "In part, there really is a tradition that justice is something determined by an experienced individual with high ethical standards and understanding of the norms of society. Justice is whatever that individual decides with full, complete knowledge of the circumstances, and no other individual who doesn't have that information can make judgments about it. The judge is like an instrument for determining what is just. And once you threaten that—and the idea of noise really threatens that—then it becomes very difficult, I think, for judges to reconcile themselves to the situation.\n\nIt's also the case that if the extent of noise in the judicial system were something that people talked about a lot, then people would lose respect for the justice system. But it's not talked about a lot. And it's quite remarkable, there are few efforts to do anything about this in the justice system.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are things that are not part of the justice system but operate in similar ways—so, asylum judges, patent officers, reviewers of grants, and even teachers who grade students in ways that determine their future. Noise in all those systems seems to potentially be the source of unfairness.\n\nIn other institutions, in insurance companies for example, it's clear that noise in underwriting is costly, and it leads to decisions that are not good for the business. I'm more hopeful about reducing noise in business than reducing noise in the judicial system. But you asked me what shocks me most—it's there."

    "true_kahneman_response": "There are circumstances where very clearly you have a critical piece of information that's a deal-breaker, and clearly deal-breakers should be allowed. You don't want a system that doesn't allow for those. What is insidious are aspects of the situation that are not by themselves deal-breakers but that people have intuitions about. Then we see that the weight that people give to the information is really not optimal, and that's where noise comes in.\n\nThe quality of people's decisions in many cases doesn't increase consistently with the amount of information that they have. There are some items of information that help, and then it reaches a point where more information is actually more likely to make you go astray than to add to the quality of your decisionmaking.\n\nIt turns out that people really do best with a small amount of information, and that when they begin to consider the details and the complexities of the individual case—except if it's a deal-breaker—they're likely to give improper weight to insignificant matters."

This reflects the academic publication's focus on policy implications and the real-world tradeoffs involved in implementing research-based solutions.",
    "question_text": "One method you've considered to reduce noise is through the use of algorithms. But there have been a lot of concerns raised about their use in decisionmaking, in particular that they might amplify racial and gender biases. How should we weigh the benefits and risks of using algorithms?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, I think that there is widespread antipathy to algorithms, and it's a special case of people's preference for the natural over the artificial. In general we prefer something that is authentic over something that is fabricated, and we prefer something that's human over something that is mechanical. And so we are strongly biased against algorithms. I think that's true for all of us. Other things being equal, we would prefer a diagnosis to be made or a sentence to be passed by a human rather than by an algorithm. That's an emotional thing.\n\nBut that feeling has to be weighed against the fact that algorithms, when they're feasible, have major advantages over human judgment—one of them being that they are noise-free. That is, when you present the same problem to an algorithm on two occasions, you are going to get the same answer. So, that's one big advantage of algorithms. The other is that they're improvable. So, if you detect a bias or you detect something that is wrong, you can improve the algorithm much more easily than you can improve human judgment.\n\nAnd the third is that humans are biased and noisy. It's not as if we're talking of humans not being biased. The biases of humans are hidden by the noise in their judgment, whereas when there is a bias in an algorithm, you can see it because there is no noise to hide it. But the idea that only algorithms are biased is ridiculous; to the extent they have their biases, they learn them from people.\n\nA famous example is, I think, an attempt to measure and predict crime in different areas. If the measure of crime is arrests, then you're going to end up with something that is grossly racially biased because arrests are grossly racially biased. So typically, the biases are introduced into algorithms by human decisions about how to define the problem. But if you take care to define the problem properly, the algorithm is not going to invent biases."

This reflects the academic publication's interest in examining potential unintended consequences of research-based policy recommendations and the broader tradeoffs involved in institutional reform.",
    "question_text": "What about the concern that rules intended to reduce noise might also reduce creativity and ingenuity? How might that happen? Are there ways to reduce noise that won't have that effect?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "Well, I think there is a real risk that when you produce procedures that guide judgment and decisionmaking, and that makes it more homogeneous and more uniform, the risk is demoralization and bureaucratization. No question, that risk exists. And so reducing noise without demoralizing people—that's a skill that has to be acquired, and clearly that's a constraint on the implementation of noise reduction techniques.\n\nWhether noise reduction will impair creativity or not, I'm really not sure. And that is because you really want to create a distinction between the final decision and the process of creating that decision. And in the process of creating a decision, diversity is a very good thing. When you're constructing a committee to make decisions—whether of hiring or of strategy—you do not want people to come from exactly the same background and to have the same inclinations. You want diversity. You want different points of view represented, and you want different sources of knowledge represented. In some occasions increasing diversity in the making of the decision could reduce noise in the decision itself.\n\nThe real deep principle of what we call decision hygiene is independence. That is, you want items of information to be as independent of each other as possible. For example, you want witnesses who don't talk to each other, and preferably who saw the same event from different perspectives. You do not want all your information to be redundant. So, good decisions are decisions that are made on the basis of diverse information."

That would be the first thing I would hope would happen.\n\nThen, it would be very interesting to study, I think, individual differences in judgment, in different kinds of judgment. Where do the differences come from, and can they be anticipated?\n\nAnd what is the real value of experience? Experience always increases confidence, and experienced people have more confidence in the quality of their judgment. But this is true even when they get absolutely no feedback from the environment about the quality of their decisions. So, underwriters never know whether they set the right premium or not, and yet they become more confident. Now, how do people become more confident? Well, it's when they begin agreeing with themselves. That's basically the criterion that, \"Oh, I had a similar problem and that's what I decided then and I feel like deciding the same thing now.\" And that gives people confidence that they're doing the right thing—with absolutely no objective justification.\n\nAlso, studying what we call \"respect-experts\"—that is, what distinguishes those people who become well-recognized experts in the absence of objective feedback? Trying to understand that phenomenon is interesting."

The operations of System 1 are fast, effortless, associative, and often emotionally charged; they're also governed by habit, so they're difficult either to modify or to control.\n\nThere is another system, System 2, which is the reasoning system.

    "summarised_context": "The conversation has moved from the evolution of risk perception research toward more specific mechanisms. Having learned that risk perception is becoming less cognitive and more emotional, the interviewer is now pinpointing the precise role of fear in decision-making processes. This reflects Strategy+Business's analytical approach, drilling down from broad concepts to specific operational details that business leaders can recognize and potentially address in their organizational contexts.",
    "question_text": "So it's not that generalized emotion influences decision making. It's that one emotion — fear — distorts the perception of risk and introduces error into decision making.",
    "true_kahneman_response": "What actually happens with fear is that probability doesn't matter very much. That is, once I have raised the possibility that something terrible can happen to your child, even though the possibility is remote, you may find it very difficult to think of anything else."

    "summarised_context": "The interview has been exploring individual decision-making and risk perception, establishing the two-system framework and how fear affects probability assessment. Now the interviewer is transitioning to group dynamics, recognizing that business decisions rarely happen in isolation. This shift reflects Strategy+Business's focus on organizational realities - executives need to understand not just individual cognitive biases but how these play out in the group settings where most important business decisions actually occur.",
    "question_text": "So even experts make cognitive mistakes. But experts and executives in organizations don't make decisions in isolation. They make decisions in meetings and committees and groups. Do we have the counterpart of System 1 and System 2 thinking in groups as well as individuals?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "We know a lot about the conditions under which groups work well and work poorly. It's really clear that groups are superior to individuals in recognizing an answer as correct when it comes up. But when everybody in a group is susceptible to similar biases, groups are inferior to individuals, because groups tend to be more extreme than individuals.\n\nYou get polarization in groups. In many situations you have a risk-taking phenomenon called the risky shift. That is, groups tend to take on more risk than individuals.\n\nWe looked at similar phenomena in juries. You collect judgments from the individual members, then you have them delivered, and then you look at the result compared to the median judgment of the group. It's straightforward what happens: The group becomes more extreme than the individuals."

    "summarised_context": "The interview has moved from theoretical frameworks (two-system theory, risk perception, group dynamics) to practical applications in business contexts. Having established the cognitive foundations, the interviewer is now exploring the real-world interaction between academic research and business practice. This question reflects Strategy+Business's core mission - understanding how psychological insights can actually be implemented in organizational settings and what barriers exist to applying research-based improvements in corporate decision-making.",
    "question_text": "How much interaction have you had with business leaders about this? Do you get senior executives asking, Look, we make a lot of decisions, we have to assess risk. What insights can you give us into how to do better risk assessment as individuals and as groups? Are there ways for us to become aware of our biases, either by setting up checklists or learning how to frame things better?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "I'm very impressed, actually, by the combination of curiosity and resistance that I encounter. The thing that astonishes me when I talk to businesspeople in the context of decision analysis is that you have an organization that's making lots of decisions and they're not keeping track. They're not trying to learn from their own mistakes; they're not investing the smallest amount in trying to actually figure out what they've done wrong. And that's not an accident: They don't want to know.\n\nSo there is a lot of curiosity, and I get invited to give lots of talks. But the idea that you might want to appoint somebody to keep statistics on the decisions that you made and a few years later evaluate the biases, the errors, the forecasts that were wrong, the factors that were misjudged, in order to make the process more rational — they won't want to do it."
