    "context": "The interviewers, Professor Karl-Gustaf Löfgren and Dr Anne-Sophie Crepin, have just introduced the 2002 Laureates in Economics, Daniel Kahneman and Vernon L. Smith. Dr. Crepin then poses the first question directly to Professor Kahneman.",
    "question_text": "Professor Kahneman, what made you decide to become a scientist?",
    "true_kahneman_response": "I wanted to be a philosopher actually and I decided, I became interested in psychology as a substitute for philosophy, as a way of answering questions about the human condition but answering them by looking at facts rather than by discussing words. So that’s how I became a psychologist."

How would you reconcile these seemingly different views, I mean both of you?' Vernon Smith answered first.
