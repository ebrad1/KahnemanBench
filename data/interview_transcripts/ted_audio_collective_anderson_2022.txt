Interview 27. TED Audio Collective 
ANDERSON: Hello welcome to the ted interview i'm chris anderson this is the podcast series where i get to sit down with a ted speaker we get to dive much deeper into their ideas than was possible during their short ted talk today i am delighted to have with us daniel kahneman danny kahneman is truly one of the greatest minds of our time he won a nobel prize in 2002 for his work on behavioral economics but his thinking has been influential not just in economics but in psychology and beyond the thing about danny is that he understands more than pretty much anyone just how weird our minds are and that means that he has something unexpected and fascinating to say about almost every psychological topic on everything from decision making through to something like happiness there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier but there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply to too many different things my goal today is to talk with danny about how we view our own minds he's been examining human behavior for close to 60 years so what an incredible opportunity to look back on some of the insights he's gained over that time and discuss how they apply to our modern age danny welcome
KAHNEMAN: It's a pleasure to be here
ANDERSON: Danny you've had this extraordinary life you're in your 80s now tell us a bit about what put you on this path in the first place
KAHNEMAN: I think i've been a psychologist since i was a child I really I always blame my mother for it or give her credit for it she was a very interesting gossip and I loved to follow her gossip the sense that people were very interesting and very complicated and that nothing was black or white I spent a lot of time and I had a lot of time during the war I spent the war years in france and then under nazi occupation in part and in part in southern france running away from them and i had a lot of time to myself because I didn't go to school all the time there were periods where it was too dangerous to go to school so I was quite an introspective little boy but but I was thinking about about psychology really well
ANDERSON: And something amazing happened in paris that you've spoken about before
KAHNEMAN: So I was seven years old it was 1941 there was a curfew for jews and we had to wear a star of david a yellow star for which we had to pay with coupons the coupons for clothing and I was visiting a friend of mine and playing and I was told it was about seven o'clock I had missed the curfew so I put on my sweater inside out and I walked home and not far from home it was a deserted street I saw somebody walking towards me and he was a german soldier not only a german soldier he was wearing a black uniform that was the uniform of dss and they were those the most frightening of all and as we came close to each other he beckoned me and picked me up and I remember being terrified that he would see inside my sweater that he was picking up a little jew he picked me up and he hugged me very tight and then he put me down and took a wallet out and showed me a picture of a little boy and gave me money
ANDERSON: So that was a story that fitted with what my mother was telling me about people being very complicated and nothing being quite black or white no one who you think is evil is completely evil no one you think is good is completely good
KAHNEMAN: That was part of it that's right that sort of thing
ANDERSON: And so this this idea of the nuance of human nature really does seem to have been a foundation of so much of what you've done because many people go through life with quite a simple picture of humans talk about the that traditional what that traditional view of human nature has been especially even in economics
KAHNEMAN: Well there are many versions of what makes humans tick a particular version is the foundation of the science of economics and this is the so-called rational agent model the assumptions that economic agents are rational they're also supposed to be selfish and they're also supposed to know what they want and of course as a psychologist this sounds wrong and of course economists know that it's wrong it's just very useful to their theories
ANDERSON: And so was it in the the 70s that you formed this extraordinary partnership with amos tversky and started to question some of these ideas tell us about how that happened
KAHNEMAN: Our partnership and our friendship actually started in 1969 i had a seminar and i invited amos to talk to us in the seminar and he presented work that was not his work but that was a mixture of the traditions of economics and psychology and the conclusion they had reached was that humans are good intuitive statisticians and i thought that was ridiculous and so we had a heated argument israelis like to argue and it was one of those arguments where you know no quarter is given but people really quite like each other at the end of that argument we decided that we wanted to pursue it and i think i won the argument so amos was interested in following up the ideas that I had expressed and then we got together and we started collaborating and then eventually fairly quickly we discovered that we really liked each other and that we really liked spending a lot of time with each other that began an exceptional collaboration that lasted about 12 years
ANDERSON: So give us a hint of it because the core of the papers that you were publishing back then were around human decision making and the many ways that we kind of get it wrong in a sense is that right
KAHNEMAN: Well we started out asking about judgment under uncertainty that is how people assess probabilities how they make intuitive predictions and how they test hypotheses
ANDERSON: Give us give us an example
KAHNEMAN: I'll give you my best example actually I think it's a fairly complicated one but your listeners will follow so suppose I ask you to think about a woman I'll call her julie I'll tell you two things about her she is a graduating senior at the university and she read fluently when she was age four when she was four years old what is her gpa and a remarkable thing happens is that you every one of you has a number a number popped into your head and a gpa for those outside the us is is grade point average so and in the us it's on a four-point scale where four is very good and everybody has a number and the number comes to mind immediately and intuitively and we know two things about that number we know exactly what happens in the mind when the number is produced and we know also with certainty that that number is statistically wrong
ANDERSON: Okay so the number I came up with was 3.5
KAHNEMAN: Well you were on the low side most people said 3.7 but I will tell you possibly because I don't know what their gpa is right you didn't go to school here I'll tell you what happens because it's an example of how intuition works so you hear she was a precocious reader quite a precautious reader and you have an impression of how precocious she was it's not that you're thinking in percentiles but you have an impression of how strong it is and let's say it is in percentiles so she is somewhere maybe the 95th percentile now you also have an idea about the distribution of gpa and if you pick the 95th percentile for julie's reading ability you find the gpa which is also the 95th percentile and that's the number that comes to your mind now this is a very complex calculation nobody is aware that this is what they did but in fact this is what they do so they take the evidence they evaluate how strong it is and then they map the evidence directly on the conclusion and that matching is the result and the reason this goes wrong is that reading is only one component of gpa there are many others so if judged just on reading that 3.7 might not be a an unreasonable guess but her actual gpa is more likely to be the best guess about her gpa is that it's slightly above average but very slightly above average that's the best guess because indeed reading age is an inferior cue to a person's gpa and yet intuitively we predict as if we could predict perfectly on the basis of weak evidence that was one of the major findings of our early research
ANDERSON: So this work and much more you had many other super productive partnerships eventually led really to the field of behavioral economics flourishing
KAHNEMAN: Well I'm sometimes described as among the founding fathers of behavior economics I'm not I really I can't accept the credit for that paternity I'm sort of the godfather the real father of behavior economics is richard thaler who got a nobel prize this year and is my best living friend I think he's a genius I think the nobel prize was overdue and I'm very very happy he got it
ANDERSON: In the way that you have described your thinking in the book that you published a few years ago thinking fast and slow you talk about these two different systems of thinking that humans have can you elaborate on that a bit
KAHNEMAN: Yeah you know it's intuitively very obvious that there are two quite different ways in which thoughts come to mind so you know if I say two plus two a number comes to mind and you can see how that number comes to mind you can feel it you didn't choose it you didn't work for it it just came to your mind that's intuitive thinking that's fast thinking and you call that system one and I call that system one there are many kinds of fast thinking when you're an experienced driver and you drive it's system one type behavior emotions are part of that fast reaction system but it's both emotion and skills and then you have another system another way of thinking which you know is exemplified by you know what happens if I ask you to multiply 17 by four now you can do it you can do it in your head but it will take you some work and it's that work that defines system two the thinking of system two of slower thinking is effortful and it's focused which means that when you're doing one thing you're severely impaired or in some cases quite incapable of doing other things so you couldn't compute 17 times 14 while taking a left turn into traffic and you'd better not try because it would blind you actually if you went on with the computation you might not see traffic
ANDERSON: So how much can you equate to those two systems with actual different parts of the brain I mean is sister one more driven by older evolved brain structures and system two is the sort of frontal cortex overlay on top of that or is that
KAHNEMAN: Well not right you know because I don't think of system one as being primarily emotional I can't locate it I mean you know so emotions are localized somewhere else entirely you know memories memory somewhere else the system two which links self-control and intelligence that is in the prefrontal cortex or you know anyway we can identify that locus uh being active when people reason and when they invest mental effort whether it be in reasoning or in self-control
ANDERSON: I mean if you're going to write a book about system one system two and argue for people that they should understand their own minds better that is an appeal really to the system two and people's minds correct
KAHNEMAN: Yes but on the other hand we have to recognize that system two is slow and inadequate and if we try to let system to govern everything we do we'd be completely paralyzed I mean we're dependent on system one to cross the street we're dependent on system one to start us eating something and stop us when we're fed system one rules really and we can't turn over everything to system two what we can do maybe is when when you realize you're in a situation where you know that you're likely to make a mistake slow down and use system two but you can only do that sparingly it is not advice for how to run your life every minute of the day
ANDERSON: So whoever came up with count to ten before losing your temper had a point
KAHNEMAN: That's exactly it yeah 10 may not be quite enough but
ANDERSON: Well it's interesting because you developed one aspect of this in a in a different way when you when you came to ted in 2010 and gave your ted talk which was about two selves I think not the system one system two selves but um what you call the experiencing self and the remembering self and I think this came out of you'd spent years now starting to think about what I think you call hedonic psychology it's the sort of the psychology of happiness and well-being and discovered some really surprising things when you actually dug into that including that it doesn't really even make sense just to ask blandly whether people are happy that question is full of pitfalls talk about those issues and about the experiencing self and the remembering self
KAHNEMAN: Well I'll describe an anecdote which highlights the difference and I was giving a talk somewhere and talking about these things about experience and memory and and somebody said well I recently listened to a symphony and it was absolutely marvelous and at the end there was something wrong with the record and there was a loud screeching sound and it ruined the whole experience and if you reflect upon that sentence you know for a moment clearly it hadn't ruined the experience he had had the experience 20 minutes of glorious music but it ruined with the memory of the experience so that indicates that there is a real difference between actual experiences and what we get to keep but we get to store and what we get to store our memories and the memories are often not faithful to the actual event the emotional memory that we keep how much we like memory how much we hate it that's very strongly affected by how it ends how the episode ended like the screech at the end of the symphony and it's completely insensitive to the duration of the experience so almost completely insensitive so how we feel about memories really doesn't correspond to essential aspects of experience
ANDERSON: This is so interesting to me because it's it's not clear to me which self we should be championing here I mean you've done this remarkable research actually lots of different categories of research that track in the moment how people are feeling and then contrast that with how they report an event after in the ted talk you talked about these colonoscopies that a longer on any reasonable basis worse colonoscopy that had more pain over more time but which eased off the pain towards the end was reported by those who suffered it as less bad than those who suffered a shorter one that stopped suddenly
KAHNEMAN: You can absolutely improve the memory of a painful medical procedure these days colonoscopy is not a good example because uh people right out no no they don't remember anything but in the days that we did that research about 20 years ago going on 25 colonoscopy was really quite painful and you felt every second of it but it turns out that you could make the mem improve the memory of the colonoscopy by just adding some time to it provided that that time was relaxed or not completely relaxed still uncomfortable but less uncomfortable than before so it can improve a memory by adding an unpleasant bit to the experience provided that it's a diminishingly unpleasant bit
ANDERSON: And so you give these other examples of vacations where the vacation that is kind of bad but ends really well will be remembered as better than than the vacation that was long and wonderful and then ended in turmoil and that was the worst one that you then you then wouldn't choose to repeat that vacation even though many ways that seems irrational I mean do you have a view as to which of those two selves are remembering self or are experiencing self we should use our system to rationality to edit and say now wait a sec don't be taken in by that bug about ourselves should we edit better for experience or should we say no it's actually the story is what matters
KAHNEMAN: Well I don't have a clear answer to that but on the vacation I had a thought experiment which I think is useful which is you're contemplating a vacation and now suppose I tell you that at the end of the vacation you'll get a drug that will make you completely amnesic you won't remember anything and will destroy all your pictures so you'll have no record of it now does that change your vacation plans and that's an important question because here the remembering self has known will have kept nothing but the experience of self will have an intact experience and if you discover that you will change your plans that means that you're having memories you're having vacations to serve your remembering self that is you are constructing memories and you want to keep them I started out the research thinking that I was completely on the side of the experience itself I said you know there are two things there is living life and thinking about it and so you live life most of the time and that's the experiencing self and occasionally you stop and you say well how am I doing you know am I satisfied with my life and that's the remembering self so I thought experience is it we should measure experience that's the real happiness what people think about it really shouldn't matter and I held that opinion quite strongly for a few years and I gave it up and the reason I gave it up was that it turns out that this is not what people want people actually want a story they want their life to be a good story and they want to add elements to that story and those elements are good memories and so people really treasure memories and want to have them and so I was faced with with the position of you know holding a view of well-being which didn't correspond to what people wanted and so I'm now confused and I admit it there are those two cells the experiencing self and the remembering self and to make them happy you would have to do different things it is not the same thing that maximizes the quality of your experiences and that maximizes your satisfaction with your life
ANDERSON: And when you say people want the story is that both their system one thinking and their system two thinking wants the story
KAHNEMAN: Oh I mean I couldn't distinguish that you know we want the story I mean that's this is very deep and the way we think of our lives is we think of our lives as a story which is why by the way death bed reconciliation sometimes matter a lot you know people think that this is a very important thing to do to get back together which in terms of experience is nonsensical but what you have done because of the imports of ending you have changed the story
ANDERSON: But it seems really important when it comes to measuring happiness or human well-being because it seems like there are two fundamentally different research methods that do this one of which essentially is tapping into the experiencing self it's asking people at random moments uh what are you feeling right now are you happy uncomfortable right now and then there's the research that just says to people more generally you know taking your life as a whole how happy would you rate yourself on a scale of one to ten which seems to be more about the remember remember itself exactly are both those research forms valid and what do they actually reveal about the world now like how different are they the results
KAHNEMAN: I'm not sure everybody would agree but I think I should take some credit for the fact that current research on well-being typically measures both it measures the emotions not by tapping every minute which is the gold standard but by asking people questions about the emotions they have experienced and in addition they're asked what do you think about your life how satisfied are you with your life so both sets of questions are asked and it turns out that they're different what makes people happy in terms of experience I believe from our research is primarily social it's primarily spending time with people you love and who love you back that's what makes people happy in the moment what makes people satisfied with their lives is much more conventional you know it's success I mean it's also having a meaningful life having I don't want to define a meaningful life but having the sense that your life is meaningful is quite important and certainly if your sense is that your life is meaningless then you're probably depressed then you're certainly very unhappy
ANDERSON: There have been all these attempts to try to find a better way of measuring society's progress that somehow bring happiness into the mix you know how happy are people um happiness numbers don't seem to have moved much in america in 50 years you know and this is causing distress how could we measure that better
KAHNEMAN: I think you've proposed that we're looking at the wrong thing that there's so much ambiguity about happiness measurements generally a much more powerful thing to focus on would be some kind of misery index of minimizing misery I mean I think if I had my brothers and I don't but uh I would rename the field and I think if we said we're studying misery it would be a less joyful topic to deal with but it would be more useful to society and steps that would be taken to reduce misery would be more acceptable I think morally to people then steps to increase happiness mental health grief counselling old age
ANDERSON: Danny it feels like your work has made a huge difference in psychology and in economics but maybe it hasn't yet percolated that far out into other fields like journalism like democracy like just everyday conversation I'm curious if you have a view on this whether you think that we could do with much broader understanding of these issues of who we are and how we make decisions
KAHNEMAN: Well it certainly wouldn't hurt for people to be psychologically sophisticated I mean that's uh if I had to choose a focus I would choose walter mischel's focus on self-control rather than trying to improve your thinking I think working on self-control is easier and more manageable and has more immediate consequences than trying to control your thoughts or reduce your cognitive biases so I'm not a great believer in individuals improving their own thinking I do believe that organizations can improve their thinking but not individuals on the other hand I think working on self-control seems to be more promising
ANDERSON: There's a lot of hand-wringing at the moment about how people's self-control on the internet for example is not that impressive we we seem to be in this culture of gut-driven outrage instant responses click bait you know it's arguably driving a sort of cycle of unintended consequences including people gathering together in clans where they inflame their own anger at each other I think you're quite pessimistic about this and about whether we could change this but it seems to me in the seeds of what you've just said that people learning that they have these two parts to them and think knowing that there are tools whereby they could gain better self-control wouldn't that over time potentially yield a better culture online as well
KAHNEMAN: Well I mean you know you speak of this this was something that we could do it would certainly be a good thing to do if we could do it but you know it would mean changing the culture it would mean changing the educational system and uh and there would be a lot of opposition so it's not easy to to see it it would be better if people were more reflected and I I think there is no doubt that the ease with which news travel has detrimental effects but quite a bit of it might be doable just by changing the attitudes in some of the big media firms and in the silicon valley firms that drive what people see you know the algorithms that drive what we see are arguably designed right now based on a kind of you know system one what what they just observe what people do in the moment they're designed for fast thinking and they don't give anyone a chance to apply their slow thinking you've never been asked by an internet site would you actually like it if we shielded you from all the clickbait crap that were otherwise put in your site to try and make money I mean people might respond to that and I think that many of the people who are building those algorithms actually have good intent um they think they're operating for human choice they're just it's just a naive view of human psychology they haven't read you they haven't understood that there might be a different way of thinking that some people would actually elect to design for if they were given the chance
KAHNEMAN: Well you know my mother was a pessimist and so I'm a pessimist and I always see the dark side of things I'm not very optimistic about changing the media I mean you you could change things at the margin but basically these are market forces and people are getting what they want
ANDERSON: And let me push back on people are getting what they want people are getting what they want in the moment of clicking absolutely but society as a whole is absolutely not getting what it wants right now and you can feel that in the huge pushback so I think redefining what we say by what we want
KAHNEMAN: I was going to make a point about think of british tabloids you know which are the naked lady on page two and the stories of murders and rapes on page one that seems to be the popular press that's you know the look at the press in new york people want a certain kind of content and the media offers it to them now the kind of world in which all the media were like npr so many of us you know would think well npr is all anybody needs but it is not all that people want and so there are market forces which push media to give people what they want in the moment and it's very difficult to fight those market forces
ANDERSON: But in the old media world there were also market forces that created if you like quality media that apply different more reflective journalistic standards one worry of the current world is that unintentionally we've built these machines that automatically suck people to you may only have tabloid content we are going to drive you into an angry person by only seeing the stuff that will you will respond to and I I think you could make the case that there is there is at least some room to open a space for more reflective online media today that reflect the broader balance that there was
KAHNEMAN: You know I I completely agree that at the margin you can make marginal changes and whether you can change the essence of the system and you know make a really big difference that I'm less optimistic about people were living in their tribes before the media it has intensified a certain kind of thing that that you're completely oblivious to the other side and there's that echo chamber effect that the new media produced that is possibly stronger than existed earlier the phenomenon of political polarization and whether that phenomenon is controlled or caused by what is happening in the media that's unclear uh or whether what the media doing is they're reflecting the fact that we are in an age of increasing polarization and my sense of that polarization started first when you look at the political history you know things started earlier I mean in the early 90s the post-reagan world in in the reagan world which many of us you know were not we didn't think that was such a great world but in the reagan world there was a lot of civility and committee between the parties there was overlap and so on polarization began in the 90s it began before the the media the media just feeding it they're not causing it
ANDERSON: Well it's interesting to you describe yourself as a pessimist I definitely I'm an optimist but um I would like to think in in the kind of um the david deutsch definition of the term which is it's not a feeling of hope about the future it's just a belief that when you have a problem there's going to be a solution there somewhere we just have to try and find it and so definitely my mind's going to keep worrying on that in search of that possible solution even if it turns out to be only a marginal one let's turn to a slightly happier topic partnerships you've had an extraordinary series of extremely productive partnerships in in your life um starting with amos talk a bit about what makes a partnership a great productive wonderful partnership
KAHNEMAN: Well one condition is that people have to like each other so they have to like to spend time with each other I mean that's for true partnerships there are different kinds of collaborations there are some collaborations where different people each bring a particular skill and all the skills are needed but there is no overlap in scale between the individuals I have been in different kinds of collaborations where actually the skill sets overlap there is something distinctive and that can be really happy when people understand each other very quickly but keep surprising each other and I've had that several times in my life and there are a few things are more pleasurable than that in you know an academic's life than a happy partnership
ANDERSON: How much of a role does humor play
KAHNEMAN: Oh you have to be laughing you have to be laughing this is unless it's funny you can't go on so laughter is really the lubricant that keeps the whole thing going
ANDERSON: And occasionally if I'm not mistaken it sometimes sparks actual ideas like like laughter that you and amos had for example would occasionally spark a research question or
KAHNEMAN: Well I mean in our case our research was ironic research I mean we studied foibles weaknesses in our own thinking and in other people thinking so the topic of our research was funny but I've had collaborations on topics that were not specifically funny and where humor was always present I don't think you can do really without it you can do really good work without it
ANDERSON: Danny will you talk a bit about the partnership with your wife anne that was a professional relationship initially
KAHNEMAN: Well not quite I mean I heard ann give a talk 51 years ago she came to harvard and cambridge she was a young phd from england and she gave her absolutely brilliant talk to a very large audience of other mighty people it was sort of uh an unusual event and she was pretty and she was nice and and and I sort of fell for her and enough so that I changed my line of work and I became more more focused on attention which is what she was studying so and not to trace her but because I had changed my line of work I went to conferences where I met her and over the years we became friends
ANDERSON: So wait wait wait wait so you changed your line of work because you were interested in attention all because you wanted to go to conferences where you would see
KAHNEMAN: My landmark work because I was interested in what she had done uh she was doing fascinating work but it had the happy side effect that you you had the happy side effect that we saw each other conferences and eventually fell for each other and now 51 years later that's been a long relationship and you've published together and we did but that was not the happiest of collaborations we we actually our marriage survived but we we had a very hard time together we published some fairly important papers but we were not yeah we were we were not very generous intellectually to each other and we were really did not have the same intellectual style
ANDERSON: Danny you've led a long and extraordinary life what does your reflective self your system to yourself your your remembering self make of that life how do you describe your own life's meaning or purpose
KAHNEMAN: I have been extraordinarily lucky in all the public aspects of my life there have been some I've been unlucky in other ways but I've been extremely lucky in my professional life and the main bit of luck is that I've met wonderful people and they've become friends and I've worked with them and it's I attribute it entirely to luck but it's also the case that I was able to exploit it and to do something with it but it's mostly my friends you know when I look back at the history it's the friends of heart I've almost never worked alone and I've always loved working with others
ANDERSON: Danny um ted's mission is to spread ideas that are worse spreading if you could inject one idea into the minds of millions of people what would the idea be
KAHNEMAN: Don't trust yourself too much don't trust in ideas and beliefs just because you can't imagine another alternative to them overconfidence is really the enemy of good thinking and I wish that sort of that humility about our beliefs could spread
ANDERSON: Danny kahneman it's been an extraordinary treat to have you for so long thank you for the generosity of your time and the generosity of your life and for the brilliance and wisdom you've brought to so many people thank you very much
KAHNEMAN: Thank you
