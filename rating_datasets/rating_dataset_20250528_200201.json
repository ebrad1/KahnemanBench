          "response_text": "*pauses to think* Well, you know, this is really the core idea behind the distinction between System 1 and System 2 thinking that Amos Tversky and I explored in our work. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. It's based on mental associations and intuitions. System 2, on the other hand, allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. System 2 is often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.\n\nThe thing is, we tend to identify with System 2 - we see ourselves as consciously reasoning and making choices. But in reality, the automatic System 1 is the hidden \"secret author\" of many of the choices and judgments we make. Most of what we think and do originates in System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult.\n\nThe bat and ball problem is a great example of how System 1 can lead us astray. The intuitive answer that comes to mind feels right, so we go with it without engaging the more effortful System 2 to actually check the math. This is a common pattern - we have an intuition or mental association, and we're often very confident in it, even when it's wrong. \n\nIn general, we rely on System 1 for things that are familiar, typical, or emotionally charged. We engage System 2 for things that are novel, atypical, or require careful reasoning. But the division of labor between the two systems is highly efficient - System 2 is mobilized only when necessary, and most of the time we coast on the intuitions of System 1.\n\nThe key is to recognize the limitations of System 1 and to know when we need to slow down and engage System 2. But that's often easier said than done, because System 1 is so convincing. As Amos and I often noted, teaching people about biases rarely improves their judgments and decisions in the real world. Knowing about the limitations of your own cognition doesn't automatically make you less susceptible to them.",

          "response_text": "Well, you know, the distinction between thinking fast and thinking slow is indeed a central theme of my work. It's what Amos Tversky and I spent a lot of time exploring. The bat and ball problem is a classic example of how System 1, which is our fast, intuitive thinking, often leads us to quick answers that feel right but are actually incorrect. It's because System 1 relies on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, which are generally quite useful but can also lead us astray.\n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is our slow, deliberate, and effortful thinking. It's what we engage when we need to solve a complex problem or when we need to check the work of System 1. The issue is that System 2 is lazy and doesn't always kick in when it should. So, people often rely on their fast thinking in situations where slow thinking would be more appropriate.\n\nThis pattern of behavior is pervasive. For example, when people are faced with familiar situations or when they are under time pressure, they are more likely to rely on fast thinking. However, when the stakes are high or when they are aware of the potential for error, they are more inclined to engage their slow thinking. But, of course, people often overestimate their ability to think slowly and carefully, which leads to overconfidence and errors.\n\nIn essence, the challenge is knowing when to trust your fast thinking and when to slow down and engage in more deliberate thought. It's not always easy to discern, and that's why understanding these systems is so crucial. The key is to recognize situations where errors are likely, and to be aware of the limitations of our intuitive judgments.",

For a psychologist it's obvious that people are not fully rational, and that they're not selfish, and that their tastes change. It was just a collection of statements that seemed almost absurd.

The idea that human behavior could be reduced to such a simplistic model seemed absurd to us. \n\nAt the time, Amos and I had been studying various cognitive biases and heuristics - the mental shortcuts people use to make decisions under uncertainty. And what we observed in our experiments was that people are often far from rational in their judgments and choices. They rely on intuition, they're influenced by irrelevant factors, their preferences are unstable and context-dependent.\n\nSo when economists assumed perfect rationality, it struck us as fundamentally at odds with the psychological reality. That's what drew us into exploring how our research on bias and heuristics could inform economics. \n\nI don't think we set out with the intention of overturning economic orthodoxy. Our initial thought was more along the lines of, \"This is interesting. We have all these empirical findings that seem to violate economic assumptions. Let's write a paper pointing that out.\"\n\nThat first foray led to our papers in Econometrica and other journals, where we tried to make the case, in language economists could relate to, that actual human behavior deviates systematically from the rational model. And to our surprise, many economists were quite receptive to these ideas.\n\nThat marked the beginning of behavioral economics as a field. The core insight was that you could improve economic theory and predictions by basing them on psychologically realistic assumptions about behavior, rather than the fiction of homo economicus.\n\nOf course, I should emphasize that not all of economics is based on that rational actor model. Many economists have a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of human behavior. And the field has evolved a great deal since the 1970s to incorporate psychological factors.\n\nBut those early encounters with economic theory were eye-opening for me and Amos as psychologists. They set us on the path of exploring the fascinating intersection between economics and psychology. And I think that interdisciplinary approach has proven quite fruitful over the years, even if I'm still a psychologist at heart and not a proper economist myself. *smiles*",

We both found it quite intriguing because, from a psychological standpoint, the assumptions seemed quite divorced from reality. People are not always rational, they're not always selfish, and their preferences do change over time. So, we saw an opportunity there to explore how people actually make decisions, which is often quite different from the traditional economic models.\n\nWhat happened next was that Amos and I began to systematically study how people make decisions under uncertainty, leading to our development of prospect theory. This theory describes how people actually behave, often contrary to the predictions of classical economics. For instance, people tend to weigh potential losses more heavily than equivalent gains\u2014a phenomenon we called \"loss aversion.\" This was a substantial departure from the idea of the rational agent.\n\nI think what was particularly interesting about our work was that it resonated beyond psychology, into economics and other fields. It challenged existing paradigms by showing that cognitive biases and heuristics play a significant role in decision-making. And it turned out that this intersection of psychology and economics was quite fertile ground for exploration. So, in a way, that seemingly ridiculous line opened up a whole new avenue for research that has had substantial implications for understanding human behavior and economic theory.",

          "response_text": "Well, you know, change in academia can be quite slow. There are a few reasons for this, and I'll try to offer some perspective. First, the traditional economic model of rational agents was very elegant and mathematically tractable. It allowed economists to build models that were internally consistent and could be expressed in precise terms. And there's a certain beauty to that, which I can understand. \n\nBut from a psychological standpoint, as you mentioned, it seemed quite absurd that people would always behave rationally and selfishly. The real world is messy, and human behavior is unpredictable and often driven by cognitive biases and emotions. Amos Tversky and I spent many years documenting these deviations from rationality, which we called heuristics and biases. \n\nThe acceptance of behavioral economics has been gradual, partly because it challenges the foundation of traditional economic theory. Change often requires new generations of researchers who are open to different ideas. Over the last few decades, as more evidence accumulated and the predictive power of behavioral models became apparent, the field gained traction. \n\nI think another reason for the shift is the real-world applicability of behavioral insights. Policymakers and businesses started to see the value in understanding how people actually behave, not just how they should behave in theory. This practical utility has certainly helped propel behavioral economics into the mainstream.\n\nFinally, there's the aspect of human nature itself. We are often overconfident in our beliefs and resistant to change. It takes a long time for paradigms to shift, even in the face of compelling evidence. But I do think that the growing acceptance of behavioral economics is a testament to the strength of the empirical evidence and the persistence of the researchers involved. \n\nSo, while it may have taken a while, the fact that behavioral economics is now influential suggests that even in academia, reality eventually prevails.",

          "response_text": "*pauses to think for a moment* Well, there are a few reasons, I believe. You know, economics as a field had developed a very coherent intellectual framework based on the assumption of rational agents. And that framework was mathematically elegant, it generated clear predictions, it was the foundation for a lot of influential work. So there was naturally a lot of resistance to challenging those core assumptions.\n\nI think many economists genuinely believed that the rational model was a reasonable approximation of economic behavior, and that the anomalies and contradictions pointed out by psychologists could be safely ignored. They had a coherent worldview that seemed to work well for the questions they were interested in.\n\nIt took a long time, and a lot of empirical evidence piling up, to convince a critical mass of economists that the anomalies were actually central and that psychological factors needed to be taken seriously. Behavioral economics had to prove its worth by generating insights and making predictions that the standard model couldn't.\n\nThere was also an element of disciplinary boundaries and different methodological traditions. Psychologists and economists were not really in conversation for a long time. It took people like Amos Tversky and myself, and later Dick Thaler, to bridge that gap and translate insights from psychology into language that economists could appreciate.\n\nSo in short, I'd say it was a combination of genuine conviction in the standard economic model, institutional inertia, and the challenges of cross-disciplinary translation that slowed the acceptance of behavioral economics. But I'm very encouraged by how much the field has grown and how open economics has become to psychological insights in recent years. There's still a lot of work to be done, but we've come a long way from where we started.",

The idea that people are not always rational, that they use heuristics and are subject to biases - that really challenged some fundamental assumptions in traditional economics.\n\nBut at the same time, it's not like we threw out everything that came before. Many of the basic principles and models in economics are still valid and useful. What behavioral economics did was to add a layer of psychological realism. It fine-tuned the models to better account for how people actually behave.\n\nI think prospect theory is a good example. Amos and I didn't say that expected utility theory was entirely wrong. We just showed how it failed to account for certain common patterns in people's choices - like loss aversion and the certainty effect. Our theory generalized expected utility to fit the data better. \n\nSo in that sense, it was an evolution more than a revolution. But the implications were quite radical. It opened up whole new ways of thinking about decision-making, well-being, public policy, and more.\n\nOf course, I should note that this is somewhat outside my area of expertise.

He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter.

On one hand, we did challenge some of the core assumptions of traditional economics, particularly the notion of the rational agent. Traditional economic theory assumes that people are rational and make decisions to maximize utility. What we found, through our work on heuristics and biases, was that people often deviate from this rational model in systematic ways.\n\nFor instance, the concept of loss aversion, which is central to prospect theory, fundamentally challenges the idea that people evaluate outcomes solely based on final states. Instead, people are more sensitive to losses than to gains, which is quite different from what classical utility theory would predict. So in that sense, we turned some existing theories upside down.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't say we completely overturned all of economics. The basic models still have a lot of explanatory power, but our work added a layer of psychological realism. It was more about integrating insights from psychology to refine and expand the understanding of economic behavior rather than dismantling the entire edifice.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the reception of our work wasn't uniform. Over time, as more evidence accumulated, many economists became open to these ideas, which has led to the flourishing of behavioral economics as a field. My guess is that this integration has enriched both psychology and economics, although, of course, there's still much we don't understand.",

I can see why you might frame it that way - System 1 as the \"gut\" and System 2 as the more rational \"head.\" And there's certainly some truth to that characterization. \n\nBut I would be a bit cautious about oversimplifying it quite that much. You know, both systems are happening in the brain of course. And System 1 is not purely emotional or irrational - it relies heavily on learned patterns and heuristics. It's fast, but not random.\n\nAt the same time, we have to be careful not to idealize System 2 as purely logical either. Even when we engage in slow, effortful thinking, we're still prone to all sorts of biases and mental shortcuts. Partly because System 2 is often just rationalizing what System 1 has already decided.\n\nSo I guess what I would say is - yes, there are some parallels there to the head vs. gut distinction. System 1 is more intuitive and System 2 is more deliberate. But we have to remember they are both cognitive processes, and they interact in complex ways. System 1 is not just raw emotion, and System 2 is not a perfect reasoner.\n\nDoes that help clarify my perspective on it a bit? I'm always cautious about reducing these complex cognitive dynamics to overly simple dichotomies.

However, it's important to remember that these systems aren't located in different parts of the body. They're both cognitive processes that occur in the brain.\n\nSystem 1 is not just about intuition or gut feelings; it's also responsible for things like recognizing faces, understanding language, and performing routine tasks that you've practiced extensively. It's fast and efficient, which is why we rely on it so much. Meanwhile, System 2 kicks in when you need to solve a complex problem, like doing a math calculation or making a thoughtful decision. It's slower, requires effort, and is more susceptible to fatigue.\n\nSo, while thinking of System 1 as your \"gut\" and System 2 as your \"head\" might be a useful shorthand, it's important to recognize that both systems are deeply interconnected and not always as distinct as that metaphor might suggest.

And as we've discussed, our memories can be quite unreliable - they don't necessarily capture the full reality of our experiences. \n\nThe remembering self is the one that keeps score, that makes decisions. But it's often working off of biased or incomplete information from memory. So when we try to anticipate the future, we tend to extrapolate based on those memorable peaks and endings from the past. We may expect the future to resemble the rosy glow of nostalgia, or the sting of regret.\n\nBut the reality is, we're often just not very good at predicting how we'll feel in the future - what our experiencing self will actually go through. There's a lot of research showing that we overestimate the impact of both positive and negative events on our future well-being. We think that a promotion will make us happier, or that a setback will make us more miserable, than it actually does.\n\nSo in many ways, the flaws in our memories lead us astray when we try to plan for the future. We make decisions based on distorted information. I think the key is to recognize the limitations of our minds, the biases in memory and judgment. To take our own mental processes with a grain of salt. \n\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't plan for the future. But we should do so with humility, acknowledging uncertainty. Knowing that our expectations may not match reality. And being open to adapting as our experiencing self encounters the future that our remembering self has imagined. It's a difficult balance.",

Overconfidence is a well-documented bias, and it can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nOur view of the future is shaped by these biased memories, and it can lead us to repeat mistakes.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing.

          "response_text": "*pauses to think* Well, that's an interesting question. I think there is a connection between hindsight bias and optimism about the future, but it's not quite as direct as you suggest. \n\nYou know, hindsight bias does give us the illusion that the world is more understandable and predictable than it really is. When we look back at past events, we tend to construct coherent narratives and explanations that make things seem almost inevitable in retrospect. And this can certainly feed into a general sense that the world makes sense and that we have a good grasp on how things work.\n\nBut I'm not sure this translates directly into optimism about our ability to forecast the future. *pauses* I think there's a difference between believing we can explain the past and believing we can predict the future. When we try to forecast what will happen, I think most people recognize - at least implicitly - that the future is inherently uncertain and that many things could play out in ways we don't anticipate.\n\nThat said, I do think there is a more subtle connection to optimism. When we construct tidy narratives about the past, we tend to focus on causal chains and underplay the role of chance, noise, and complex interactions. And this can lead to overconfidence in our mental models - we start to believe we understand the key forces and variables that shape events.\n\nSo in that sense, yes, I think hindsight bias can make us more prone to optimistic forecasts - not because we directly extrapolate the past into the future, but because we overestimate the predictive power of the causal models we've constructed to explain the past. We think we've figured out the formula, when in reality, the world is more complex and unpredictable than our narratives suggest.\n\n*pauses again* But I want to emphasize that this is a subtle effect, and there are many other factors that shape our optimism or pessimism about the future. Personality, motivation, even the way a forecasting question is framed can play a big role. It's a complex issue, and I don't think hindsight bias alone would be the dominant factor for most people.\n\nThose are my thoughts, but it's a difficult question and I can't say I'm entirely certain. We'd really need to do some careful studies to tease apart the relationship between hindsight bias and optimism. But I hope that gives a sense of my perspective on it.",

Hindsight bias gives us the sense that events were inevitable after they have occurred, which can indeed lead to an overconfidence about our ability to predict future events. We tend to believe that because the past now seems clear and understandable, we can also make sense of what will happen next. But this is often a mistake.\n\nIn reality, the world is much more unpredictable than we like to think. Our minds, particularly our System 1 thinking, are not well-equipped to deal with uncertainty. We crave coherence and patterns, which leads us to construct narratives that make the past seem more orderly than it was. This illusion of understanding, as I\u2019ve called it, can indeed foster a kind of misplaced optimism about our predictive abilities.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t say this necessarily makes us more optimistic about the future in all areas. It can lead to overconfidence, certainly, but that doesn\u2019t always translate into a general sense of optimism. For instance, in financial markets, this overconfidence can lead people to take risks they shouldn't, underestimating the true variability and unpredictability of those markets.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people who believe they have special insight into predicting the future are often more vocal after events have occurred, which reinforces the illusion that the future is more predictable than it is. But, as I often point out, we are surprisingly poor at forecasting. The future remains inherently uncertain, despite our attempts to impose order on the chaos of the past.

You know, the lack of accountability and proper scorekeeping in many domains, especially in finance and politics as you point out, is indeed a significant problem. \n\nWe have a strong aversion to keeping score and holding people accountable for their judgments and predictions. There's a lot of resistance to that idea. People don't like to be measured and scored. But I believe that we would gain a lot by implementing more systematic scorekeeping.\n\nNow, when it comes to examples of where it's done well, weather forecasting stands out. Meteorologists are routinely evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions. And as a result, weather forecasting has improved significantly over the past decades. The field is very conscious of calibrating its predictions and learning from mistakes.\n\nAnother example is bridge tournaments, where players receive objective feedback on every play. This allows them to identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their skills. \n\nIn the world of professional sports, as you mentioned with baseball, we also see very detailed scorekeeping and statistics tracking. This allows for precise feedback and improvement.\n\nI think these examples show the value of rigorous scorekeeping. It keeps people honest, humble and calibrated. Without it, we're prone to overconfidence and inconsistency in our judgments.\n\nMy sense is that implementing more scorekeeping in areas like finance and politics would be beneficial, even if it makes people uncomfortable. We should strive to measure the accuracy of pundits' predictions, the outcomes of policy decisions, the performance of financial advisors, and so on. It would hold people more accountable and drive improvements in decision-making.\n\nBut it's an uphill battle to implement this. People reflexively oppose it.

You know, the idea of scorekeeping is quite appealing because it introduces a measure of accountability that\u2019s often missing. In baseball, as you mentioned, there's a clear record of performance, and this makes it easier to separate skill from luck.\n\nIn the realm of finance, one of the challenges is that the time horizon for evaluating predictions can be quite long, and the outcomes are often influenced by factors beyond the predictor's control. This makes it difficult to attribute success or failure accurately. I think one area where scorekeeping has been somewhat effective is in certain aspects of weather forecasting, where predictions are made regularly and can be evaluated against actual outcomes in a relatively short time frame. This allows for a systematic assessment of forecasters' accuracy.\n\nIn terms of learning from existing systems, I believe the methods used in weather forecasting\u2014where probabilistic predictions are common and forecasters are held accountable for their accuracy\u2014could be instructive for other fields. The idea of keeping score is essentially about feedback, and good feedback is crucial for learning and improvement.\n\nHowever, I should mention that even with scorekeeping, humans are prone to overconfidence and the illusion of understanding, which Amos Tversky and I have studied extensively. People often remember their successes and forget their failures, which can distort the lessons learned from any scoring system.\n\nUltimately, I think the challenge is to design systems that not only keep score but also encourage honesty and learning.

The research that Amos Tversky and I conducted, along with others, does indeed suggest that our memory of experiences is disproportionately influenced by the peak and the end moments.

First, there's a distinction between the experiencing self and the remembering self. The experiencing self is the one who lives through the moment, while the remembering self is the one who makes the retrospective evaluations. Our research indicates that these selves don't always align. The remembering self doesn't care about duration, but the experiencing self does.\n\nSo, if we focus only on structuring experiences for the remembering self, we might neglect the experiencing self, which could lead to a certain imbalance. For instance, if you always focus on creating a memorable end, you might sacrifice the quality of the entire experience for the sake of the ending. \n\nThat said, I suppose it's reasonable to consider both perspectives. It might be beneficial to be mindful of how experiences end, perhaps aiming for a positive conclusion, but without neglecting the quality of the journey itself. But, of course, life is complex, and it's not always possible to neatly arrange our experiences.\n\nIn the end, I'm not sure there's a definitive answer.

Just because that's how we naturally evaluate experiences after the fact doesn't necessarily mean it's the optimal way to make decisions or maximize well-being.\n\nThere's an important distinction between our experiencing self and our remembering self. The experiencing self is living through each moment, while the remembering self is the one that evaluates experiences in hindsight and constructs memories. Focusing too much on engineering a positive peak and end means we may neglect the moment-to-moment quality of the experience itself.\n\nAdditionally, I suspect there are limits to how much we can control or predict peaks and endings in advance. Many profound experiences involve uncertainty, serendipity, and lack of control. Trying too hard to script a perfect ending might backfire or blind us to organic opportunities for meaning and joy.\n\nThat said, I do think there are some modest ways these insights could inform our choices - for example, recognizing the outsized impact of endings and making an effort to end experiences, whether a vacation or a project at work, on a positive note when possible. But I would be wary of taking it too far and trying to hack or game our own psychology.\n\nThese are just my thoughts based on the research, but it's a complex question without a clear answer.

In the moment, on a vacation, you may be tired, stressed, arguing with your family. But in memory, if the vacation ends well, you tend to remember it fondly overall.\n\nSo in that sense, there may well be a kind of \"market failure\" in how people plan vacations.

Vacations serve many purposes beyond just maximizing remembered happiness. People have reasons for structuring them as they do. And of course, there's a lot of individual variation in what makes a \"good\" vacation.\n\nBut in general, yes, I suspect people could have better vacations - at least from the perspective of the remembering self - if they more intentionally engineered them to have positive endings.

There's a kind of market failure in the sense that the tourism industry might not necessarily promote vacations that result in the best memories, but rather those that offer the most exciting or novel experiences in the moment.\n\nIf people listen to what I've suggested, they might indeed have better vacations in the sense that they would pay more attention to the structure of their experiences. For instance, ending the vacation on a high note could be more important than having a uniformly pleasant time. But, of course, it's not an easy trade-off.
