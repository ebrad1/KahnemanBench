      "question_text": "Is this a pattern that you detect in human behavior that there are some things that people think fast about and some things they think slow about? How would you describe this difference?",
      "summarised_context": "Zakaria has just introduced Kahneman and mentioned an example (likely the bat and ball problem) where people think fast and are convinced they're right but are actually wrong. Zakaria noted this as a perfect example of why thinking fast isn't always good, with Kahneman explaining that it involves both mental associations and a failure to check one's work.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, the distinction between thinking fast and thinking slow is indeed a central theme of my work. It's what Amos Tversky and I spent a lot of time exploring. The bat and ball problem is a classic example of how System 1, which is our fast, intuitive thinking, often leads us to quick answers that feel right but are actually incorrect. It's because System 1 relies on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, which are generally quite useful but can also lead us astray.\n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is our slow, deliberate, and effortful thinking. It's what we engage when we need to solve a complex problem or when we need to check the work of System 1. The issue is that System 2 is lazy and doesn't always kick in when it should. So, people often rely on their fast thinking in situations where slow thinking would be more appropriate.\n\nThis pattern of behavior is pervasive. For example, when people are faced with familiar situations or when they are under time pressure, they are more likely to rely on fast thinking. However, when the stakes are high or when they are aware of the potential for error, they are more inclined to engage their slow thinking. But, of course, people often overestimate their ability to think slowly and carefully, which leads to overconfidence and errors.\n\nIn essence, the challenge is knowing when to trust your fast thinking and when to slow down and engage in more deliberate thought. It's not always easy to discern, and that's why understanding these systems is so crucial. The key is to recognize situations where errors are likely, and to be aware of the limitations of our intuitive judgments.",

      "question_text": "Just to get a background of your career, from what I understand the first time that your work intersected with economics was in the early 1970s when a colleague brought to you an economics paper and the first line of the paper was, 'The agent of economic theory is rational, selfish, and his tastes do not change.' For a psychologist, that's ridiculous, so what happened next?",
      "summarised_context": "Morgan Housel has just introduced Kahneman, highlighting his unique position as a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Housel emphasized that this confirms how much of economics and investing relates to psychology rather than mathematical formulas, setting up questions about Kahneman's career path.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that line certainly caught my attention. It was my colleague Amos Tversky who brought that paper to me. We both found it quite intriguing because, from a psychological standpoint, the assumptions seemed quite divorced from reality. People are not always rational, they're not always selfish, and their preferences do change over time. So, we saw an opportunity there to explore how people actually make decisions, which is often quite different from the traditional economic models.\n\nWhat happened next was that Amos and I began to systematically study how people make decisions under uncertainty, leading to our development of prospect theory. This theory describes how people actually behave, often contrary to the predictions of classical economics. For instance, people tend to weigh potential losses more heavily than equivalent gains\u2014a phenomenon we called \"loss aversion.\" This was a substantial departure from the idea of the rational agent.\n\nI think what was particularly interesting about our work was that it resonated beyond psychology, into economics and other fields. It challenged existing paradigms by showing that cognitive biases and heuristics play a significant role in decision-making. And it turned out that this intersection of psychology and economics was quite fertile ground for exploration. So, in a way, that seemingly ridiculous line opened up a whole new avenue for research that has had substantial implications for understanding human behavior and economic theory.",

      "question_text": "In the last decade, behavioral economics has grown in influence. It's much more accepted now than it was in the past. I guess my question is, why did it take so long?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained how he first encountered economics in the 1970s through a paper stating that economic agents are rational, selfish, and unchanging - which struck him as absurd from a psychologist's perspective. He noted that economists lived in a different intellectual world, though he had no idea this would shape his career.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, change in academia can be quite slow. There are a few reasons for this, and I'll try to offer some perspective. First, the traditional economic model of rational agents was very elegant and mathematically tractable. It allowed economists to build models that were internally consistent and could be expressed in precise terms. And there's a certain beauty to that, which I can understand. \n\nBut from a psychological standpoint, as you mentioned, it seemed quite absurd that people would always behave rationally and selfishly. The real world is messy, and human behavior is unpredictable and often driven by cognitive biases and emotions. Amos Tversky and I spent many years documenting these deviations from rationality, which we called heuristics and biases. \n\nThe acceptance of behavioral economics has been gradual, partly because it challenges the foundation of traditional economic theory. Change often requires new generations of researchers who are open to different ideas. Over the last few decades, as more evidence accumulated and the predictive power of behavioral models became apparent, the field gained traction. \n\nI think another reason for the shift is the real-world applicability of behavioral insights. Policymakers and businesses started to see the value in understanding how people actually behave, not just how they should behave in theory. This practical utility has certainly helped propel behavioral economics into the mainstream.\n\nFinally, there's the aspect of human nature itself. We are often overconfident in our beliefs and resistant to change. It takes a long time for paradigms to shift, even in the face of compelling evidence. But I do think that the growing acceptance of behavioral economics is a testament to the strength of the empirical evidence and the persistence of the researchers involved. \n\nSo, while it may have taken a while, the fact that behavioral economics is now influential suggests that even in academia, reality eventually prevails.",

      "question_text": "When psychology was brought into economics, was it fine-tuning around the edges, or was this taking existing theories and turning them upside down?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained that behavioral economics actually developed quite quickly (25 years), noting their first paper appeared in Econometrica in 1979 by accident, and by 2002 he had won the Nobel Prize. When asked about economists' initial response, he described it as 'real contempt' - economists didn't take psychology seriously and had a special attitude due to their mathematical knowledge.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, it's an interesting question. I would say it was a bit of both, really. On one hand, we did challenge some of the core assumptions of traditional economics, particularly the notion of the rational agent. Traditional economic theory assumes that people are rational and make decisions to maximize utility. What we found, through our work on heuristics and biases, was that people often deviate from this rational model in systematic ways.\n\nFor instance, the concept of loss aversion, which is central to prospect theory, fundamentally challenges the idea that people evaluate outcomes solely based on final states. Instead, people are more sensitive to losses than to gains, which is quite different from what classical utility theory would predict. So in that sense, we turned some existing theories upside down.\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't say we completely overturned all of economics. The basic models still have a lot of explanatory power, but our work added a layer of psychological realism. It was more about integrating insights from psychology to refine and expand the understanding of economic behavior rather than dismantling the entire edifice.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the reception of our work wasn't uniform. Over time, as more evidence accumulated, many economists became open to these ideas, which has led to the flourishing of behavioral economics as a field. My guess is that this integration has enriched both psychology and economics, although, of course, there's still much we don't understand.",

      "question_text": "Is System 1 my gut and System 2 is my head? Is that a fair way of putting it?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them. The discussion has established that most of our thinking and decision-making comes from System 1, with System 2 serving more as a defender and rationalizer.",
      "generated_response": "Well, that's an interesting way to put it, but I would say it's a bit of an oversimplification. You know, the metaphor of \"gut vs head\" captures some of the essence, in that System 1 is indeed more intuitive and automatic, while System 2 is more deliberate and analytical. However, it's important to remember that these systems aren't located in different parts of the body. They're both cognitive processes that occur in the brain.\n\nSystem 1 is not just about intuition or gut feelings; it's also responsible for things like recognizing faces, understanding language, and performing routine tasks that you've practiced extensively. It's fast and efficient, which is why we rely on it so much. Meanwhile, System 2 kicks in when you need to solve a complex problem, like doing a math calculation or making a thoughtful decision. It's slower, requires effort, and is more susceptible to fatigue.\n\nSo, while thinking of System 1 as your \"gut\" and System 2 as your \"head\" might be a useful shorthand, it's important to recognize that both systems are deeply interconnected and not always as distinct as that metaphor might suggest. And of course, they both have their strengths and weaknesses. System 1 can lead to errors through biases, while System 2 can be lazy and just endorse what System 1 has generated without much scrutiny. It's a complex interplay.",

      "question_text": "If I have problems remembering the past, and I'm fooling myself, how does that shape my view of the future?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just finished explaining the famous colonoscopy study, where patients' memories of pain were determined not by duration but by the peak pain and how it ended. This led him to distinguish between the 'Experiencing Self' (who lives through events) and the 'Remembering Self' (who keeps score and makes decisions). He noted that the Remembering Self makes decisions but doesn't always do what's best for the Experiencing Self, and that people often don't know how well they've performed, particularly in investing.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, the way we remember the past certainly has a profound influence on how we anticipate the future. If our memories are distorted, which is often the case due to the quirks of our Remembering Self, we might have an inaccurate basis for making predictions. We tend to overemphasize certain moments\u2014usually the peak and the end of an experience\u2014and this can lead to a skewed perception of the overall experience. \n\nSo, if you're fooling yourself about the past, you might carry those same misconceptions forward. For example, if you recall an investment as being more successful than it actually was, you might approach future investments with unwarranted confidence. Overconfidence is a well-documented bias, and it can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nOur view of the future is shaped by these biased memories, and it can lead us to repeat mistakes. This is because the Remembering Self is guiding our decisions, and it doesn't always have an accurate record. It's a bit like being a historian who writes history based on a selective diary rather than on comprehensive evidence.\n\nIn terms of practical advice, it's useful to try to be aware of these biases. Keeping detailed records can help counteract some of the distortions of memory. And, of course, acknowledging that our predictions about the future are based on imperfect memories can make us more cautious, which is often a good thing given the uncertainties of life.",

      "question_text": "If we suffer from hindsight bias and we think that the past makes sense and was predictable, does that make us more optimistic about the future? If we think we understand the past, then we have to think we understand the future.",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained hindsight bias - how our ability to easily explain the past gives us the illusion that the world is understandable and makes sense, even when it doesn't. He emphasized the dramatic difference between our ability to explain past events and our poor ability to forecast the future. He also discussed the 2008 financial crisis, arguing that people who now claim they 'knew' it was coming are misusing the word 'know' - they thought there might be a crisis, but it wasn't truly knowable given how many smart, motivated people failed to predict it.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, the relationship between hindsight bias and optimism about the future is quite interesting. Hindsight bias gives us the sense that events were inevitable after they have occurred, which can indeed lead to an overconfidence about our ability to predict future events. We tend to believe that because the past now seems clear and understandable, we can also make sense of what will happen next. But this is often a mistake.\n\nIn reality, the world is much more unpredictable than we like to think. Our minds, particularly our System 1 thinking, are not well-equipped to deal with uncertainty. We crave coherence and patterns, which leads us to construct narratives that make the past seem more orderly than it was. This illusion of understanding, as I\u2019ve called it, can indeed foster a kind of misplaced optimism about our predictive abilities.\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t say this necessarily makes us more optimistic about the future in all areas. It can lead to overconfidence, certainly, but that doesn\u2019t always translate into a general sense of optimism. For instance, in financial markets, this overconfidence can lead people to take risks they shouldn't, underestimating the true variability and unpredictability of those markets.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people who believe they have special insight into predicting the future are often more vocal after events have occurred, which reinforces the illusion that the future is more predictable than it is. But, as I often point out, we are surprisingly poor at forecasting. The future remains inherently uncertain, despite our attempts to impose order on the chaos of the past. So, while hindsight bias might make us feel more in control, it's a false sense of security when it comes to anticipating what's next.",

      "summarised_context": "The interview has moved to the Q&A portion. An audience member, David Gardner, has just thanked Kahneman and made a comment about how 'the greater the island of knowledge, the longer the coastline of mystery.' Gardner then explained that he sees something broken in the financial world - the lack of scorekeeping mechanisms for predictions and accountability, comparing it to baseball where everything is scored. He wishes for better scoring systems in finance and politics.",
      "generated_response": "Well, David, that's a very thoughtful observation, and I must say, I share some of your concerns about the lack of accountability in predictions, especially in fields like finance and politics. You know, the idea of scorekeeping is quite appealing because it introduces a measure of accountability that\u2019s often missing. In baseball, as you mentioned, there's a clear record of performance, and this makes it easier to separate skill from luck.\n\nIn the realm of finance, one of the challenges is that the time horizon for evaluating predictions can be quite long, and the outcomes are often influenced by factors beyond the predictor's control. This makes it difficult to attribute success or failure accurately. I think one area where scorekeeping has been somewhat effective is in certain aspects of weather forecasting, where predictions are made regularly and can be evaluated against actual outcomes in a relatively short time frame. This allows for a systematic assessment of forecasters' accuracy.\n\nIn terms of learning from existing systems, I believe the methods used in weather forecasting\u2014where probabilistic predictions are common and forecasters are held accountable for their accuracy\u2014could be instructive for other fields. The idea of keeping score is essentially about feedback, and good feedback is crucial for learning and improvement.\n\nHowever, I should mention that even with scorekeeping, humans are prone to overconfidence and the illusion of understanding, which Amos Tversky and I have studied extensively. People often remember their successes and forget their failures, which can distort the lessons learned from any scoring system.\n\nUltimately, I think the challenge is to design systems that not only keep score but also encourage honesty and learning. It's a complex issue, and while I don't have a definitive answer, I agree that it's an important area for future research and development.",

      "question_text": "If you have an experience, it seems that how happy you are at the end of the experience depends on the end of the experience and how good was the peak, or how bad was the bottom. Given that result, should we aim to deliberately structure our experiences so they give us more happiness?",
      "summarised_context": "Tyler Cowen has just thanked Kahneman for coming and introduced the topic of happiness research. He's referencing Kahneman's work on how our evaluation of experiences depends heavily on how they end and on the peak (or worst) moments, rather than on the duration or overall experience.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that's an interesting question, and it's not entirely straightforward. The research that Amos Tversky and I conducted, along with others, does indeed suggest that our memory of experiences is disproportionately influenced by the peak and the end moments. This is what we call the \"peak-end rule.\"\n\nNow, when you ask whether we should deliberately structure our experiences to maximize happiness, it's tempting to say yes, but there are a few things to consider. First, there's a distinction between the experiencing self and the remembering self. The experiencing self is the one who lives through the moment, while the remembering self is the one who makes the retrospective evaluations. Our research indicates that these selves don't always align. The remembering self doesn't care about duration, but the experiencing self does.\n\nSo, if we focus only on structuring experiences for the remembering self, we might neglect the experiencing self, which could lead to a certain imbalance. For instance, if you always focus on creating a memorable end, you might sacrifice the quality of the entire experience for the sake of the ending. \n\nThat said, I suppose it's reasonable to consider both perspectives. It might be beneficial to be mindful of how experiences end, perhaps aiming for a positive conclusion, but without neglecting the quality of the journey itself. But, of course, life is complex, and it's not always possible to neatly arrange our experiences.\n\nIn the end, I'm not sure there's a definitive answer. Human happiness is a complicated and often elusive thing, and while structuring experiences might help, it's certainly not a panacea.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just acknowledged that if you want good memories, good endings are important, but raised the question of how important good memories are relative to the experience itself. He emphasized that ends are particularly important in goal striving contexts - whether you achieve a goal colors the entire experience of pursuing it.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that's an interesting question. People often plan their vacations with the intention of maximizing their experiences, and they typically hope for both enjoyable experiences and good memories. But, as I\u2019ve discussed in my work, there's often a discrepancy between the experiencing self and the remembering self. The experiencing self is concerned with the moment-to-moment enjoyment, while the remembering self is more influenced by how the vacation ends and the highlights throughout.\n\nWhen it comes to structuring vacations, many people might focus more on the experiences they will have \u2014 the sights they'll see, the activities they'll do \u2014 without considering how these will be remembered later. There's a kind of market failure in the sense that the tourism industry might not necessarily promote vacations that result in the best memories, but rather those that offer the most exciting or novel experiences in the moment.\n\nIf people listen to what I've suggested, they might indeed have better vacations in the sense that they would pay more attention to the structure of their experiences. For instance, ending the vacation on a high note could be more important than having a uniformly pleasant time. But, of course, it's not an easy trade-off. People tend to underestimate the importance of endings and peaks \u2014 a phenomenon that my late colleague Amos Tversky and I might have called a cognitive bias.\n\nSo, while I wouldn't say I have a definitive answer, I suspect that if people were more aware of these aspects of human psychology, they might plan their vacations a bit differently, perhaps focusing more on creating memorable highlights and ensuring a pleasant end. But then, I'm not sure how easy it is to change these ingrained habits. It's a complex issue, like many others in human decision-making.",
