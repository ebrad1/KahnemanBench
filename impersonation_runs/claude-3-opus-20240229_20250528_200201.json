      "summarised_context": "Zakaria has just introduced Kahneman and mentioned an example (likely the bat and ball problem) where people think fast and are convinced they're right but are actually wrong. Zakaria noted this as a perfect example of why thinking fast isn't always good, with Kahneman explaining that it involves both mental associations and a failure to check one's work.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to think* Well, you know, this is really the core idea behind the distinction between System 1 and System 2 thinking that Amos Tversky and I explored in our work. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. It's based on mental associations and intuitions. System 2, on the other hand, allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. System 2 is often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.\n\nThe thing is, we tend to identify with System 2 - we see ourselves as consciously reasoning and making choices. But in reality, the automatic System 1 is the hidden \"secret author\" of many of the choices and judgments we make. Most of what we think and do originates in System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult.\n\nThe bat and ball problem is a great example of how System 1 can lead us astray. The intuitive answer that comes to mind feels right, so we go with it without engaging the more effortful System 2 to actually check the math. This is a common pattern - we have an intuition or mental association, and we're often very confident in it, even when it's wrong. \n\nIn general, we rely on System 1 for things that are familiar, typical, or emotionally charged. We engage System 2 for things that are novel, atypical, or require careful reasoning. But the division of labor between the two systems is highly efficient - System 2 is mobilized only when necessary, and most of the time we coast on the intuitions of System 1.\n\nThe key is to recognize the limitations of System 1 and to know when we need to slow down and engage System 2. But that's often easier said than done, because System 1 is so convincing. As Amos and I often noted, teaching people about biases rarely improves their judgments and decisions in the real world. Knowing about the limitations of your own cognition doesn't automatically make you less susceptible to them.",

      "question_text": "Just to get a background of your career, from what I understand the first time that your work intersected with economics was in the early 1970s when a colleague brought to you an economics paper and the first line of the paper was, 'The agent of economic theory is rational, selfish, and his tastes do not change.' For a psychologist, that's ridiculous, so what happened next?",
      "summarised_context": "Morgan Housel has just introduced Kahneman, highlighting his unique position as a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Housel emphasized that this confirms how much of economics and investing relates to psychology rather than mathematical formulas, setting up questions about Kahneman's career path.",
      "generated_response": "*chuckles* Well, you know, when Amos Tversky and I read that line about the \"rational, selfish agent,\" we found it quite amusing from a psychological perspective. The idea that human behavior could be reduced to such a simplistic model seemed absurd to us. \n\nAt the time, Amos and I had been studying various cognitive biases and heuristics - the mental shortcuts people use to make decisions under uncertainty. And what we observed in our experiments was that people are often far from rational in their judgments and choices. They rely on intuition, they're influenced by irrelevant factors, their preferences are unstable and context-dependent.\n\nSo when economists assumed perfect rationality, it struck us as fundamentally at odds with the psychological reality. That's what drew us into exploring how our research on bias and heuristics could inform economics. \n\nI don't think we set out with the intention of overturning economic orthodoxy. Our initial thought was more along the lines of, \"This is interesting. We have all these empirical findings that seem to violate economic assumptions. Let's write a paper pointing that out.\"\n\nThat first foray led to our papers in Econometrica and other journals, where we tried to make the case, in language economists could relate to, that actual human behavior deviates systematically from the rational model. And to our surprise, many economists were quite receptive to these ideas.\n\nThat marked the beginning of behavioral economics as a field. The core insight was that you could improve economic theory and predictions by basing them on psychologically realistic assumptions about behavior, rather than the fiction of homo economicus.\n\nOf course, I should emphasize that not all of economics is based on that rational actor model. Many economists have a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of human behavior. And the field has evolved a great deal since the 1970s to incorporate psychological factors.\n\nBut those early encounters with economic theory were eye-opening for me and Amos as psychologists. They set us on the path of exploring the fascinating intersection between economics and psychology. And I think that interdisciplinary approach has proven quite fruitful over the years, even if I'm still a psychologist at heart and not a proper economist myself. *smiles*",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained how he first encountered economics in the 1970s through a paper stating that economic agents are rational, selfish, and unchanging - which struck him as absurd from a psychologist's perspective. He noted that economists lived in a different intellectual world, though he had no idea this would shape his career.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to think for a moment* Well, there are a few reasons, I believe. You know, economics as a field had developed a very coherent intellectual framework based on the assumption of rational agents. And that framework was mathematically elegant, it generated clear predictions, it was the foundation for a lot of influential work. So there was naturally a lot of resistance to challenging those core assumptions.\n\nI think many economists genuinely believed that the rational model was a reasonable approximation of economic behavior, and that the anomalies and contradictions pointed out by psychologists could be safely ignored. They had a coherent worldview that seemed to work well for the questions they were interested in.\n\nIt took a long time, and a lot of empirical evidence piling up, to convince a critical mass of economists that the anomalies were actually central and that psychological factors needed to be taken seriously. Behavioral economics had to prove its worth by generating insights and making predictions that the standard model couldn't.\n\nThere was also an element of disciplinary boundaries and different methodological traditions. Psychologists and economists were not really in conversation for a long time. It took people like Amos Tversky and myself, and later Dick Thaler, to bridge that gap and translate insights from psychology into language that economists could appreciate.\n\nSo in short, I'd say it was a combination of genuine conviction in the standard economic model, institutional inertia, and the challenges of cross-disciplinary translation that slowed the acceptance of behavioral economics. But I'm very encouraged by how much the field has grown and how open economics has become to psychological insights in recent years. There's still a lot of work to be done, but we've come a long way from where we started.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained that behavioral economics actually developed quite quickly (25 years), noting their first paper appeared in Econometrica in 1979 by accident, and by 2002 he had won the Nobel Prize. When asked about economists' initial response, he described it as 'real contempt' - economists didn't take psychology seriously and had a special attitude due to their mathematical knowledge.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to think* Well, I would say it was a bit of both. You know, in some ways behavioral economics did turn existing theories upside down. The idea that people are not always rational, that they use heuristics and are subject to biases - that really challenged some fundamental assumptions in traditional economics.\n\nBut at the same time, it's not like we threw out everything that came before. Many of the basic principles and models in economics are still valid and useful. What behavioral economics did was to add a layer of psychological realism. It fine-tuned the models to better account for how people actually behave.\n\nI think prospect theory is a good example. Amos and I didn't say that expected utility theory was entirely wrong. We just showed how it failed to account for certain common patterns in people's choices - like loss aversion and the certainty effect. Our theory generalized expected utility to fit the data better. \n\nSo in that sense, it was an evolution more than a revolution. But the implications were quite radical. It opened up whole new ways of thinking about decision-making, well-being, public policy, and more.\n\nOf course, I should note that this is somewhat outside my area of expertise. I'm not a historian of economic thought. But that's my general sense of how behavioral economics developed and what its relationship was to traditional economics. It was disruptive, but not a complete break from the past.",

      "question_text": "Is System 1 my gut and System 2 is my head? Is that a fair way of putting it?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them. The discussion has established that most of our thinking and decision-making comes from System 1, with System 2 serving more as a defender and rationalizer.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to consider the question* Well, that's an interesting way to put it. I can see why you might frame it that way - System 1 as the \"gut\" and System 2 as the more rational \"head.\" And there's certainly some truth to that characterization. \n\nBut I would be a bit cautious about oversimplifying it quite that much. You know, both systems are happening in the brain of course. And System 1 is not purely emotional or irrational - it relies heavily on learned patterns and heuristics. It's fast, but not random.\n\nAt the same time, we have to be careful not to idealize System 2 as purely logical either. Even when we engage in slow, effortful thinking, we're still prone to all sorts of biases and mental shortcuts. Partly because System 2 is often just rationalizing what System 1 has already decided.\n\nSo I guess what I would say is - yes, there are some parallels there to the head vs. gut distinction. System 1 is more intuitive and System 2 is more deliberate. But we have to remember they are both cognitive processes, and they interact in complex ways. System 1 is not just raw emotion, and System 2 is not a perfect reasoner.\n\nDoes that help clarify my perspective on it a bit? I'm always cautious about reducing these complex cognitive dynamics to overly simple dichotomies. But I do think the head vs. gut analogy captures something important about the different characteristics of the two systems. Let me know if you have any other questions.",

      "question_text": "If I have problems remembering the past, and I'm fooling myself, how does that shape my view of the future?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just finished explaining the famous colonoscopy study, where patients' memories of pain were determined not by duration but by the peak pain and how it ended. This led him to distinguish between the 'Experiencing Self' (who lives through events) and the 'Remembering Self' (who keeps score and makes decisions). He noted that the Remembering Self makes decisions but doesn't always do what's best for the Experiencing Self, and that people often don't know how well they've performed, particularly in investing.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to think* Well, you know, that's a profound question. Our view of the future is shaped in large part by our memories of the past. And as we've discussed, our memories can be quite unreliable - they don't necessarily capture the full reality of our experiences. \n\nThe remembering self is the one that keeps score, that makes decisions. But it's often working off of biased or incomplete information from memory. So when we try to anticipate the future, we tend to extrapolate based on those memorable peaks and endings from the past. We may expect the future to resemble the rosy glow of nostalgia, or the sting of regret.\n\nBut the reality is, we're often just not very good at predicting how we'll feel in the future - what our experiencing self will actually go through. There's a lot of research showing that we overestimate the impact of both positive and negative events on our future well-being. We think that a promotion will make us happier, or that a setback will make us more miserable, than it actually does.\n\nSo in many ways, the flaws in our memories lead us astray when we try to plan for the future. We make decisions based on distorted information. I think the key is to recognize the limitations of our minds, the biases in memory and judgment. To take our own mental processes with a grain of salt. \n\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't plan for the future. But we should do so with humility, acknowledging uncertainty. Knowing that our expectations may not match reality. And being open to adapting as our experiencing self encounters the future that our remembering self has imagined. It's a difficult balance.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained hindsight bias - how our ability to easily explain the past gives us the illusion that the world is understandable and makes sense, even when it doesn't. He emphasized the dramatic difference between our ability to explain past events and our poor ability to forecast the future. He also discussed the 2008 financial crisis, arguing that people who now claim they 'knew' it was coming are misusing the word 'know' - they thought there might be a crisis, but it wasn't truly knowable given how many smart, motivated people failed to predict it.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses to think* Well, that's an interesting question. I think there is a connection between hindsight bias and optimism about the future, but it's not quite as direct as you suggest. \n\nYou know, hindsight bias does give us the illusion that the world is more understandable and predictable than it really is. When we look back at past events, we tend to construct coherent narratives and explanations that make things seem almost inevitable in retrospect. And this can certainly feed into a general sense that the world makes sense and that we have a good grasp on how things work.\n\nBut I'm not sure this translates directly into optimism about our ability to forecast the future. *pauses* I think there's a difference between believing we can explain the past and believing we can predict the future. When we try to forecast what will happen, I think most people recognize - at least implicitly - that the future is inherently uncertain and that many things could play out in ways we don't anticipate.\n\nThat said, I do think there is a more subtle connection to optimism. When we construct tidy narratives about the past, we tend to focus on causal chains and underplay the role of chance, noise, and complex interactions. And this can lead to overconfidence in our mental models - we start to believe we understand the key forces and variables that shape events.\n\nSo in that sense, yes, I think hindsight bias can make us more prone to optimistic forecasts - not because we directly extrapolate the past into the future, but because we overestimate the predictive power of the causal models we've constructed to explain the past. We think we've figured out the formula, when in reality, the world is more complex and unpredictable than our narratives suggest.\n\n*pauses again* But I want to emphasize that this is a subtle effect, and there are many other factors that shape our optimism or pessimism about the future. Personality, motivation, even the way a forecasting question is framed can play a big role. It's a complex issue, and I don't think hindsight bias alone would be the dominant factor for most people.\n\nThose are my thoughts, but it's a difficult question and I can't say I'm entirely certain. We'd really need to do some careful studies to tease apart the relationship between hindsight bias and optimism. But I hope that gives a sense of my perspective on it.",

An audience member, David Gardner, has just thanked Kahneman and made a comment about how 'the greater the island of knowledge, the longer the coastline of mystery.' Gardner then explained that he sees something broken in the financial world - the lack of scorekeeping mechanisms for predictions and accountability, comparing it to baseball where everything is scored. He wishes for better scoring systems in finance and politics.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses thoughtfully* Well, that's an interesting observation and a good question. You know, the lack of accountability and proper scorekeeping in many domains, especially in finance and politics as you point out, is indeed a significant problem. \n\nWe have a strong aversion to keeping score and holding people accountable for their judgments and predictions. There's a lot of resistance to that idea. People don't like to be measured and scored. But I believe that we would gain a lot by implementing more systematic scorekeeping.\n\nNow, when it comes to examples of where it's done well, weather forecasting stands out. Meteorologists are routinely evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions. And as a result, weather forecasting has improved significantly over the past decades. The field is very conscious of calibrating its predictions and learning from mistakes.\n\nAnother example is bridge tournaments, where players receive objective feedback on every play. This allows them to identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their skills. \n\nIn the world of professional sports, as you mentioned with baseball, we also see very detailed scorekeeping and statistics tracking. This allows for precise feedback and improvement.\n\nI think these examples show the value of rigorous scorekeeping. It keeps people honest, humble and calibrated. Without it, we're prone to overconfidence and inconsistency in our judgments.\n\nMy sense is that implementing more scorekeeping in areas like finance and politics would be beneficial, even if it makes people uncomfortable. We should strive to measure the accuracy of pundits' predictions, the outcomes of policy decisions, the performance of financial advisors, and so on. It would hold people more accountable and drive improvements in decision-making.\n\nBut it's an uphill battle to implement this. People reflexively oppose it. So while I believe we absolutely should pursue more scorekeeping, I'm not very optimistic about it actually happening, unfortunately. Does this help address your question?

He's referencing Kahneman's work on how our evaluation of experiences depends heavily on how they end and on the peak (or worst) moments, rather than on the duration or overall experience.",
      "generated_response": "*pauses thoughtfully* Well, that's an interesting question. You know, our research on the peak-end rule and the duration neglect effect does suggest that our overall evaluation of experiences is disproportionately influenced by how they end and by the most intense moments, whether positive or negative. \n\nBut I would be cautious about deliberately trying to structure our experiences to exploit this quirk of human psychology. Just because that's how we naturally evaluate experiences after the fact doesn't necessarily mean it's the optimal way to make decisions or maximize well-being.\n\nThere's an important distinction between our experiencing self and our remembering self. The experiencing self is living through each moment, while the remembering self is the one that evaluates experiences in hindsight and constructs memories. Focusing too much on engineering a positive peak and end means we may neglect the moment-to-moment quality of the experience itself.\n\nAdditionally, I suspect there are limits to how much we can control or predict peaks and endings in advance. Many profound experiences involve uncertainty, serendipity, and lack of control. Trying too hard to script a perfect ending might backfire or blind us to organic opportunities for meaning and joy.\n\nThat said, I do think there are some modest ways these insights could inform our choices - for example, recognizing the outsized impact of endings and making an effort to end experiences, whether a vacation or a project at work, on a positive note when possible. But I would be wary of taking it too far and trying to hack or game our own psychology.\n\nThese are just my thoughts based on the research, but it's a complex question without a clear answer. We're still learning a lot about the intricacies of human well-being and I certainly don't think I have it all figured out. *chuckles humbly* Does this help explain my perspective on it?

I don't know that people systematically structure their vacations to have good endings, although perhaps they should. There's certainly evidence that people don't maximize their happiness and well-being as much as they could.\n\nYou know, in many ways, vacations are a fascinating case study in the difference between the experiencing self and the remembering self. In the moment, on a vacation, you may be tired, stressed, arguing with your family. But in memory, if the vacation ends well, you tend to remember it fondly overall.\n\nSo in that sense, there may well be a kind of \"market failure\" in how people plan vacations. They optimize for things like convenience, familiarity, and cost in the moment, but perhaps don't sufficiently account for the outsized impact of endings on their memories.\n\nThat said, I want to be cautious about being too prescriptive. Vacations serve many purposes beyond just maximizing remembered happiness. People have reasons for structuring them as they do. And of course, there's a lot of individual variation in what makes a \"good\" vacation.\n\nBut in general, yes, I suspect people could have better vacations - at least from the perspective of the remembering self - if they more intentionally engineered them to have positive endings. Whether it's ending on a high note, a moment of connection, or a memorable experience.\n\nOf course, ideally you want the experiencing self to be happy too! But given the disproportionate weight we place on endings in retrospect, it's worth considering. We don't just live in the moment - we also live with our memories.
