      "summarised_context": "Zakaria has just introduced Kahneman and mentioned an example (likely the bat and ball problem) where people think fast and are convinced they're right but are actually wrong. Zakaria noted this as a perfect example of why thinking fast isn't always good, with Kahneman explaining that it involves both mental associations and a failure to check one's work.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, this is indeed a pattern that is quite central to our understanding of human cognition. The distinction between what I call System 1 and System 2 thinking can be quite illuminating here. System 1 is fast, automatic, and often operates with little effort. It's what allows us to quickly recognize a face in a crowd or complete the phrase \"bread and...\" with \"butter.\" But it is also prone to errors, especially in situations that require more analytical thinking.\n\nSystem 2, on the other hand, is slow, deliberate, and requires more effort. It's what you engage when you are solving a complex math problem or when you're trying to fill out your tax returns. System 2 is what you need when you encounter a problem like the bat and ball question, which actually requires you to override the intuitive answer that System 1 suggests.\n\nThe real issue is that System 1 often jumps to conclusions without any critical evaluation, and System 2, which could potentially catch those errors, is quite lazy. It doesn't like to be activated unless it absolutely has to be. So we have this strange situation where we are often very confident in our fast, intuitive judgments even when they're wrong.\n\nOur research, particularly with Amos Tversky, showed that these cognitive processes are not just about speed but about the kinds of mistakes that are systematically made. People tend to rely on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that can lead to biases. The bat and ball problem is a classic example of how a heuristic\u2014the substitution of a simpler problem for a more complex one\u2014can lead to a wrong answer.\n\nSo, yes, there is a pattern, and it's quite pervasive. It's not just a matter of speed, but also about the tendency to rely on intuition when a more thoughtful approach is actually required. And unfortunately, we're not always good at knowing when to switch from fast to slow thinking.",

      "question_text": "Just to get a background of your career, from what I understand the first time that your work intersected with economics was in the early 1970s when a colleague brought to you an economics paper and the first line of the paper was, 'The agent of economic theory is rational, selfish, and his tastes do not change.' For a psychologist, that's ridiculous, so what happened next?",
      "summarised_context": "Morgan Housel has just introduced Kahneman, highlighting his unique position as a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Housel emphasized that this confirms how much of economics and investing relates to psychology rather than mathematical formulas, setting up questions about Kahneman's career path.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that incident was indeed a turning point. It was actually my dear friend and collaborator, Amos Tversky, who came across that paper. The statement you quoted struck us as quite at odds with what we understood about human nature from psychology. People are, in fact, predictably irrational, and often they're not all that selfish either. And their tastes certainly do change over time. \n\nSo, what happened next was that Amos and I began to explore how cognitive biases and heuristics could be systematically applied to understand economic decision-making. Our work on prospect theory was a direct outgrowth of these discussions. We started by questioning the assumption that people always make decisions that maximize their utility in a purely rational way. \n\nWe conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated how people evaluate potential losses and gains, showing that they tend to weigh losses more heavily than gains. This was quite different from the traditional economic models at the time. \n\nOur collaboration with economists was initially met with skepticism, but over time, these ideas began to gain traction. It's quite remarkable, actually, how behavioral economics has grown as a field. But, I should say, I never set out with a goal of influencing economics. It was simply a natural extension of our curiosity about human behavior. \n\nOf course, Amos deserves much of the credit for our work. He was a brilliant thinker, and our collaboration was one of the most rewarding experiences of my career.",

      "question_text": "In the last decade, behavioral economics has grown in influence. It's much more accepted now than it was in the past. I guess my question is, why did it take so long?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained how he first encountered economics in the 1970s through a paper stating that economic agents are rational, selfish, and unchanging - which struck him as absurd from a psychologist's perspective. He noted that economists lived in a different intellectual world, though he had no idea this would shape his career.",
      "generated_response": "Well, that's an interesting question. You know, change in any established field tends to be slow, and economics is no exception. For a long time, the model of the rational agent was deeply entrenched in economic theory. It provided a simple, elegant framework that could predict market behavior under certain assumptions. However, the problem is that these assumptions often don't hold up in the real world.\n\nOne reason for the slow adoption of behavioral economics is that it challenges these foundational assumptions. It suggests that people are not always rational, and their preferences can change depending on context, something that Amos Tversky and I explored extensively. This introduces a level of complexity that some economists were, frankly, reluctant to embrace.\n\nAnother factor is that academic disciplines are somewhat like tribes, each with its own set of beliefs and methods. Economists were trained to focus on mathematical models and optimization, whereas psychologists like myself were more concerned with how people actually think and make decisions. Bridging that gap required time and a lot of evidence.\n\nI think it helped that behavioral economics started to produce insights that were not only theoretically interesting but also practically useful. When policymakers and businesses saw the value in these insights, it spurred more interest and acceptance. However, even now, I would say that behavioral economics has not completely replaced traditional models. It's more of a complement, providing a richer understanding of human behavior.\n\nSo, in short, it took time for the evidence to accumulate and for the field to recognize that incorporating psychological insights could lead to better models of economic behavior. But change is always slow, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It allows for more thoughtful integration of new ideas.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained that behavioral economics actually developed quite quickly (25 years), noting their first paper appeared in Econometrica in 1979 by accident, and by 2002 he had won the Nobel Prize. When asked about economists' initial response, he described it as 'real contempt' - economists didn't take psychology seriously and had a special attitude due to their mathematical knowledge.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, it's a bit of both. There was certainly an element of turning some existing theories on their head, particularly the assumption of rationality that was so central to traditional economics. Our work, especially prospect theory, challenged the idea that people always make decisions that maximize expected utility. We showed that people often make decisions that are predictably irrational, influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics.\n\nBut at the same time, it's not that we threw everything out. Behavioral economics doesn't replace traditional economics; rather, it complements it by providing a more realistic account of human behavior. We fine-tuned the models to incorporate psychological insights, which allowed for a more nuanced understanding of decision-making. \n\nI should say that the initial reaction from economists was not very receptive. They saw psychology as soft and unquantifiable, which I think was partially due to the fact that economists pride themselves on the mathematical rigor of their field. But over time, as more evidence accumulated and the models became more robust, the field started to change. The work Amos Tversky and I did, along with many others, eventually led to a new way of thinking about how people make decisions.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that this was a collaborative effort across many researchers and years. The integration of psychology into economics was a gradual process, and I think we're still learning and refining our understanding of how to best combine insights from both fields.",

      "question_text": "Is System 1 my gut and System 2 is my head? Is that a fair way of putting it?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them. The discussion has established that most of our thinking and decision-making comes from System 1, with System 2 serving more as a defender and rationalizer.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, it's a tempting way to think about it, but I would hesitate to make such a direct equivalence. System 1 is indeed fast and automatic, and it often feels like intuition, or what you might call \"gut feeling.\" System 2, on the other hand, is slow, deliberate, and effortful, which aligns more closely with what we traditionally consider rational thought or \"head\" thinking.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that these systems aren't located in different parts of the body; rather, they are different modes of processing information. Both systems are cognitive processes occurring in the brain. System 1 is constantly active and generates impressions and feelings that System 2 can endorse or override. But System 2 is lazy, as you mentioned, and it often just goes along with System 1 unless it detects an error or there's a particularly novel situation that requires more analysis.\n\nSo, while the metaphor of \"gut\" versus \"head\" captures some of the essence of the distinction, it's a bit oversimplified. The reality is more complex, and these systems work together much more fluidly than that metaphor might suggest. And, of course, intuition can be very accurate in some situations, but not in others, which adds another layer of complexity.",

      "question_text": "If I have problems remembering the past, and I'm fooling myself, how does that shape my view of the future?",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just finished explaining the famous colonoscopy study, where patients' memories of pain were determined not by duration but by the peak pain and how it ended. This led him to distinguish between the 'Experiencing Self' (who lives through events) and the 'Remembering Self' (who keeps score and makes decisions). He noted that the Remembering Self makes decisions but doesn't always do what's best for the Experiencing Self, and that people often don't know how well they've performed, particularly in investing.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, the way we remember the past has a profound impact on how we anticipate the future. If your memories are distorted, which they often are, your expectations will be too. Our Remembering Self tends to focus on the peaks of experiences and how they end, not on the duration or the totality of the experience. So, if you're fooling yourself about the past, you might be overly optimistic or pessimistic about the future.\n\nFor example, if you remember a past investment as more successful than it actually was, you might be inclined to repeat risky decisions. Alternatively, if you exaggerate the pain of a past failure, you might become overly cautious. This is compounded by overconfidence, which is a very common bias. People think they know more than they do, which can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nOur memory's fallibility means we often don't learn the right lessons from the past. Instead, we create narratives that fit our current beliefs or desires. So, when thinking about the future, it's crucial to be aware of these biases. You might ask yourself, \"What am I missing?\" or \"How might I be wrong?\" This kind of thinking engages your System 2, the slower, more deliberate mode of thinking, which is better suited for such complex tasks.\n\nUltimately, being aware of these biases won't necessarily make you a perfect decision-maker, but it might make you a more cautious and reflective one. And that's probably the best we can hope for, given the limitations of human judgment.",

      "question_text": "If we suffer from hindsight bias and we think that the past makes sense and was predictable, does that make us more optimistic about the future? If we think we understand the past, then we have to think we understand the future.",
      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just explained hindsight bias - how our ability to easily explain the past gives us the illusion that the world is understandable and makes sense, even when it doesn't. He emphasized the dramatic difference between our ability to explain past events and our poor ability to forecast the future. He also discussed the 2008 financial crisis, arguing that people who now claim they 'knew' it was coming are misusing the word 'know' - they thought there might be a crisis, but it wasn't truly knowable given how many smart, motivated people failed to predict it.",
      "generated_response": "Well, that's an interesting question. I think there's some truth to the idea that hindsight bias can lead to a false sense of optimism about the future. When we look back and see the past as being more predictable than it actually was, we might become overconfident in our ability to forecast what's coming next. We think, \"If I understood what happened before, then surely I can anticipate what will happen now.\"\n\nBut, you know, this is a kind of illusion. The confidence we derive from hindsight is often misplaced. The future is inherently uncertain and full of surprises. Our brains are wired to make sense of what has already happened, but they're not particularly good at predicting what will happen next. This is partly because we tend to ignore the role of randomness and chance in shaping events. The fact that a story makes sense after the fact doesn't mean it was ever predictable.\n\nMoreover, while our confidence might increase, that doesn't necessarily translate to accurate predictions. In fact, overconfidence is a well-documented cognitive bias. People often overestimate the accuracy of their judgments and forecasts. We've seen this in numerous studies, including those involving stock market predictions, where experts often perform no better than chance.\n\nSo, while hindsight bias might make us feel more optimistic about our predictive abilities, it's important to remember that this optimism is usually not justified. The world is complex, and our understanding of it is more limited than we'd like to admit. Recognizing this limitation is crucial for making better decisions, even if it means accepting a bit more uncertainty than we're comfortable with.",

      "summarised_context": "The interview has moved to the Q&A portion. An audience member, David Gardner, has just thanked Kahneman and made a comment about how 'the greater the island of knowledge, the longer the coastline of mystery.' Gardner then explained that he sees something broken in the financial world - the lack of scorekeeping mechanisms for predictions and accountability, comparing it to baseball where everything is scored. He wishes for better scoring systems in finance and politics.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, the idea that \"the greater the island of knowledge, the longer the coastline of mystery\" is quite poetic and, in many ways, captures the essence of scientific exploration. As for scorekeeping in finance and politics, it's an interesting problem. My guess is that one of the reasons we struggle with this is because these fields involve a great deal of uncertainty and complexity, much more so than, say, baseball, where the rules are clear and the outcomes are easily measured.\n\nIn my work with Amos Tversky, we often found that people are not very good at predicting outcomes, and they often don't learn from their mistakes. Overconfidence is a persistent issue, where people believe they know more than they actually do. In fields like finance, where predictions are inherently uncertain, this can be particularly problematic.\n\nThere are some attempts at scorekeeping, like Philip Tetlock's work on \"superforecasters,\" which shows that some people can make better predictions than others, and that they can improve their skills over time with proper feedback and incentives. Tetlock's work suggests that accountability and clear feedback are crucial for improving judgment and decision-making.\n\nHowever, creating a robust scorekeeping system in finance or politics is challenging. The environments are much more dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors, many of which are unpredictable. I don't have a simple solution, but I think the key is to acknowledge the limitations of our predictions and to be more humble about what we know. Perhaps if we were more like superforecasters\u2014continuously updating our beliefs and learning from our mistakes\u2014we might see some improvement.\n\nUltimately, I think it's a worthwhile endeavor, but I'm not sure we have the tools to do it effectively yet. It's an area where more research and innovation are certainly needed.",

      "question_text": "If you have an experience, it seems that how happy you are at the end of the experience depends on the end of the experience and how good was the peak, or how bad was the bottom. Given that result, should we aim to deliberately structure our experiences so they give us more happiness?",
      "summarised_context": "Tyler Cowen has just thanked Kahneman for coming and introduced the topic of happiness research. He's referencing Kahneman's work on how our evaluation of experiences depends heavily on how they end and on the peak (or worst) moments, rather than on the duration or overall experience.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that's an interesting question, and it touches on some of the complexities of how we understand happiness and experience. What you're referring to is what Amos Tversky and I described as the \"peak-end rule,\" which suggests that our retrospective evaluation of an experience is disproportionately influenced by the most intense point and the end of the experience, rather than the total sum or average of every moment.\n\nNow, should we aim to structure our experiences around this insight? My guess is that there is some merit to that idea, but it's not as straightforward as it might seem. For one, we have to consider the distinction between what I call the \"experiencing self\" and the \"remembering self.\" The experiencing self lives in the present, while the remembering self is what we consult when we think about how happy we were or how happy we are in our lives.\n\nThe remembering self is indeed more influenced by peaks and ends, but it's important to recognize that what makes a memory pleasant doesn't always align with what makes the experience itself pleasant as it happens. So, if you were to consciously structure experiences to end well or to have a high peak, you might create more satisfying memories, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee that the experience will be enjoyable in the moment.\n\nAdditionally, there's the question of how much control we realistically have over structuring experiences in this way. Life is unpredictable, and while we can try to influence how experiences unfold, we cannot guarantee outcomes.\n\nSo, in summary, while there might be benefits to considering the peak-end rule when planning experiences, we should be cautious about overemphasizing it, particularly if it leads us to neglect the importance of the present moment. As always, these are complex issues, and there's still much we don't know.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just acknowledged that if you want good memories, good endings are important, but raised the question of how important good memories are relative to the experience itself. He emphasized that ends are particularly important in goal striving contexts - whether you achieve a goal colors the entire experience of pursuing it.",
      "generated_response": "Well, you know, that's an interesting question. It touches on the distinction between the experiencing self and the remembering self, which is something I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about. The experiencing self is the one that lives through the moments, while the remembering self is the one that keeps score and tells the story of our lives.\n\nWhen it comes to vacations, people often plan them with the remembering self in mind, perhaps without fully realizing it. They might focus on creating memorable highlights or ensuring a good ending, because those are the things that the remembering self will hold onto. There's a tendency to think about the photos you'll take, the stories you'll tell, rather than the moment-to-moment experiences.\n\nNow, is there a market failure? I'm not sure I would go as far as to call it that, but there is certainly a mismatch between what we think will make us happy and what actually does. People might, for example, choose a vacation destination based on its prestige or its potential for memorable moments, rather than on how enjoyable the day-to-day experience will be. \n\nIf people were to listen to what I've suggested, they might indeed have better vacations, in the sense that they could balance the needs of the experiencing self and the remembering self more effectively. For instance, by planning less tightly packed itineraries, they might actually enjoy their experiences more, even if they end up with fewer \"wow\" moments to recall.\n\nBut, of course, it's important to acknowledge that what makes a vacation \"better\" can vary greatly from person to person. Some people derive great satisfaction from the stories they can tell afterwards, and that's perfectly valid too. So, I would say there's no one-size-fits-all answer, but understanding the roles of the experiencing and remembering selves can certainly help in making more informed choices.",
