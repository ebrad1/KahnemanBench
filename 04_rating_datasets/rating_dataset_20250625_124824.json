      "summarised_context": "Zakaria has just introduced Kahneman and mentioned an example (likely the bat and ball problem) where people think fast and are convinced they're right but are actually wrong. Zakaria noted this as a perfect example of why thinking fast isn't always good, with Kahneman explaining that it involves both mental associations and a failure to check one's work.",

          "response_text": "Well, yes, absolutely. What we have is a distinction between two modes of thinking, often referred to as System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, automatic, and often relies on heuristics\u2014essentially mental shortcuts that allow us to make quick judgments and decisions. It\u2019s intuitive and operates with little effort. On the other hand, System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and requires effortful mental activity. \n\nYou know, the bat and ball problem illustrates this beautifully. When faced with that question, many people immediately say the ball costs 10 cents, because that\u2019s a quick, intuitive response from System 1. But when you engage System 2, and you really think it through, you realize that the correct answer is that the ball costs 5 cents.\n\nWhat we found was that people often rely on System 1 for problems that they perceive as simple or familiar, while they might switch to System 2 when they encounter something they recognize as complex or challenging. However, the problem is that people frequently misjudge the difficulty of a question. They think they understand it well enough to use System 1 when, in fact, a more thoughtful approach is warranted.\n\nSo yes, there's a pattern in human behavior: we oscillate between these two systems, and often, we trust our fast thinking too much, leading us to errors. The key takeaway is that being aware of this distinction can help us make better decisions, especially in situations where our intuition might lead us astray.",

And it turns out that by and large we clearly - most people are wired to avoid it. We try to do as little as possible of the slow thinking. It's very hard work.

I was working in the field of psychology, studying judgment and decision-making, and the idea that humans are perfectly rational and self-interested seemed disconnected from how people actually behave in real life. \n\nWhat happened next was a bit of an intellectual journey. I started to collaborate with Amos Tversky, and together we began to explore the ways in which people deviate from that idealized model of rationality. We conducted experiments that highlighted cognitive biases and heuristics\u2014essentially, the mental shortcuts that people use when making decisions. \n\nOne of our key insights was that people often rely on intuitive thinking, which we called System 1, rather than the more deliberate, analytical thinking of System 2. This framework helped to illuminate many of the irrational behaviors we observed, and it turned out to have significant implications for economics, particularly in understanding how people make financial decisions. \n\nSo, in a way, that initial absurdity prompted a series of inquiries that led to a deeper understanding of economic behavior through the lens of psychology.

          "response_text": "Well, that's a great question. You know, I think one reason it took so long is that the traditional economic model is deeply entrenched in the intellectual framework of economics. Economists have built a lot on the idea of rationality, and that framework has been very successful in many ways, particularly in creating a sense of predictability and order in economic behavior.\n\nIt also turns out that people are quite resistant to change in their beliefs. The cognitive biases we study, such as confirmation bias, play a role here. Many economists were simply not inclined to question the assumptions they had been operating under. \n\nMoreover, there was a lack of empirical evidence at the beginning. The early work in behavioral economics, including my own, was often seen as anecdotal or not rigorous enough compared to the mathematical models that dominated the field. It took time for researchers to develop more robust methodologies and to accumulate evidence that could withstand scrutiny.\n\nWhat we found was that as more studies emerged, showing the systematic ways in which human behavior deviates from rationality, the tide began to shift. The collaboration with Amos Tversky was crucial in this regard. We provided not just a critique of traditional economics but also a framework\u2014prospect theory, for instance\u2014that could explain and predict behaviors in a way that resonated with both psychologists and economists.\n\nIn the last decade, I think we\u2019ve also seen a growing recognition of the importance of interdisciplinary approaches. Behavioral economics has started to gain traction because it offers valuable insights into policy-making and business practices. So, it\u2019s been a gradual process, and while I\u2019m pleased to see the acceptance, I remain somewhat skeptical about how deeply these ideas are integrated into mainstream economics.

What we found was that many traditional economic theories, particularly those based on the idea of rational agents, did not hold up when we looked at how people actually make decisions. \n\nFor example, prospect theory, which Amos Tversky and I developed, showed that people evaluate potential losses and gains differently\u2014people are loss averse. This was a significant departure from the expected utility theory that economists had relied on for decades. So, in that sense, it turned some existing theories upside down.\n\nThe introduction of psychological insights into economics revealed systematic biases and heuristics that people use, which traditional models often ignored. It wasn't just about refining models; it was about fundamentally rethinking how we understand decision-making under uncertainty.

He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter. The assumptions have been challenged, but economics is still pretty much the same discipline it was.",

He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them.

That's System 1 and it demands a lot of alertness to cues. The 'gut' -- to say System 1 is the gut -- that suggests that there is no thinking there. The best thinking we do is System 1. Creativity is stuff that comes from your memory. It's in that sense System 1. It doesn't work the way we think it works, but it's not that System 2 is more elevated than System 1. Actually, it's...

System 1, which we often associate with gut feelings, operates quickly and intuitively. It\u2019s the part of our thinking that reacts almost automatically to situations, drawing from experience and patterns. System 2, on the other hand, is more analytical and deliberate, akin to what you might think of as the head. It requires effort and is often invoked when we face complex problems or when our initial impressions from System 1 need to be checked.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that both systems are integral to our decision-making. While System 1 can be surprisingly effective, it\u2019s also prone to biases. System 2 can correct some of those errors, but it often doesn't engage when it should. So, while your analogy is not incorrect, it\u2019s also worth remembering that the relationship between the two is more nuanced than simply gut versus head.

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has just finished explaining the famous colonoscopy study, where patients' memories of pain were determined not by duration but by the peak pain and how it ended. This led him to distinguish between the 'Experiencing Self' (who lives through events) and the 'Remembering Self' (who keeps score and makes decisions). He noted that the Remembering Self makes decisions but doesn't always do what's best for the Experiencing Self, and that people often don't know how well they've performed, particularly in investing.",

The Remembering Self tends to reconstruct the past in a way that can be quite misleading. For instance, we tend to focus on peak experiences and how things ended, rather than the overall duration or the actual content of the experience. This can lead to a distorted view of our past performance.\n\nIf you're fooling yourself about the past, this can certainly shape your expectations for the future. You might overestimate your abilities or the likelihood of success based on an inaccurate memory of past events. This overconfidence can lead to poor decision-making, particularly in areas like investing, where people often believe they have a better grasp of the situation than they actually do.\n\nWhat we found in our studies is that people are generally quite poor at assessing their own performance. They often remember their successes more vividly than their failures, which can create an illusion of competence. So, if you're not accurately recalling your past experiences, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment or taking unnecessary risks in the future.\n\nIt's a complex interplay, really. The way we remember can skew our perceptions, and those perceptions influence our decisions moving forward.

We explain the past with the greatest of ease, and we're really crummy at forecasting the future.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing.

Hindsight bias does give us a sense of understanding about the past, which can lead to an illusion of clarity and predictability. When we look back, we often see a sequence of events that feels coherent, and this can foster a sense of confidence in our ability to predict future events.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily translate to genuine optimism about the future. What we find is that people can be overconfident in their judgments, and this overconfidence can lead to poor decision-making. They might believe they understand the dynamics of a situation based on past events, but that doesn't mean they actually have the tools to accurately forecast what will happen next.\n\nIn fact, if you look at many studies, including some of my own work with Amos Tversky, you'll see that people often underestimate uncertainty and complexity in future scenarios. They might feel optimistic based on their understanding of the past, but that optimism can be misplaced. They fail to recognize that the future is inherently unpredictable, and this can lead to catastrophic consequences, as we saw during the financial crisis.\n\nSo, in a sense, while hindsight might give us a false sense of understanding, it can also lead us to a form of overconfidence that is not necessarily optimistic but rather misguided. The complexity of the future remains, regardless of how clear the past appears.

So, creating a robust scorekeeping system could help mitigate that by providing a more objective measure of predictions and outcomes.\n\nI think one interesting example of scorekeeping comes from the field of forecasting competitions, like the Good Judgment Project. It gathered forecasters and tracked their accuracy over time, allowing for a more empirical understanding of who can make the best predictions. This kind of approach could inspire similar systems in finance and politics, where we could evaluate decisions against actual outcomes.\n\nUltimately, the challenge is to create a culture where accountability is prioritized, and where individuals are encouraged to learn from their mistakes rather than simply moving on without reflection. My guess is that without such systems, we are likely to continue facing the same issues of overconfidence and lack of accountability. It's a complex problem, but I believe there are lessons to be learned from other domains.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a fascinating question. What we found was that the way we remember experiences is significantly influenced by the peak moments and the ending, which we refer to as the peak-end rule. This suggests that if we want to maximize happiness, we might indeed consider how to structure our experiences more deliberately. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this isn\u2019t a straightforward solution. For one, what makes a peak moment pleasurable can vary widely from person to person. Also, there\u2019s the risk of over-optimizing for happiness in a way that might lead to disappointment. \n\nYou know, in some cases, trying too hard to create positive peaks or perfect endings can lead to a kind of pressure that detracts from the experience itself. There\u2019s also the danger of focusing too much on the anticipated happiness and not enough on the actual experience. \n\nIn essence, while there\u2019s value in being aware of how peaks and endings affect our memories and feelings, I would suggest a balanced approach. It\u2019s not just about structuring experiences to be optimally happy but also allowing ourselves to engage with the full range of experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014that life offers. The richness of experience is often more meaningful than the pursuit of happiness alone.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's an interesting question. You know, I think there is a certain awareness among people about the importance of memories and how they influence our overall happiness. However, many still tend to focus on the immediate pleasures of the experience rather than on how those experiences will be remembered later. \n\nWhat we found was that people often overlook the role of the ending in their overall assessment of an experience. So, in the context of vacations, they might prioritize activities that seem enjoyable in the moment, but they don't necessarily consider how those activities will shape their memories once the vacation is over.\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of market failure in that sense. People might not be fully aware of the psychological principles that could help them plan better vacations. For instance, if individuals understood the significance of a good ending, they might structure their trips differently\u2014perhaps by ensuring that the last day is particularly enjoyable or by avoiding stressful travel arrangements that could taint their overall perception of the vacation.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s a matter of balancing immediate enjoyment with the long-term memories we create. If people were more conscious of this, I think they could indeed have better vacations. But there\u2019s a limit to how much we can expect individuals to change their behavior based on this understanding, especially when they\u2019re caught up in the excitement of the experience itself.",
