Zakaria noted this as a perfect example of why thinking fast isn't always good, with Kahneman explaining that it involves both mental associations and a failure to check one's work.",

          "response_text": "Well, absolutely. What we find is that human thinking can be divided into two systems, which I refer to as System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and often automatic; it operates with little effort and is responsible for our immediate reactions and judgments. For example, when you see a bat and a ball priced at $1.10, and you instinctively say the bat costs $1, that\u2019s System 1 at work. \n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and requires effort. It kicks in when we face more complex problems or when our intuition leads us astray. If you pause to think about that bat and ball problem, you might realize that the bat actually costs $1.05 and the ball costs only $0.05. \n\nThis distinction is critical because there are areas where people tend to rely on their fast thinking, and that can lead to errors. In contrast, more complicated problems or those that require careful reasoning often engage System 2. However, people don\u2019t always recognize when they need to switch from System 1 to System 2, and that's where biases and mistakes can creep in.\n\nWhat we found was that this pattern of thinking can lead to overconfidence. People often feel certain about their fast answers, even when they are wrong. It's a fascinating interplay, and it underscores the limitations of human judgment. The challenge, of course, is knowing when to trust our instincts and when to question them.",

And it turns out that by and large we clearly - most people are wired to avoid it. We try to do as little as possible of the slow thinking. It's very hard work.

For a psychologist it's obvious that people are not fully rational, and that they're not selfish, and that their tastes change. It was just a collection of statements that seemed almost absurd.

My colleague, it was actually Amos Tversky, brought it to me, and we both found it quite amusing and, frankly, deeply unrealistic. We started discussing how people actually make decisions, which often involves biases and heuristics that aren't accounted for in traditional economic models.\n\nWhat we found was that the so-called rational agent doesn't reflect how people think and behave in real life. Instead, our research began to explore these deviations from rationality. We conducted experiments that demonstrated, for example, how people's decisions can be influenced by the way options are presented to them\u2014a phenomenon we later described with prospect theory.\n\nThis intersection of psychology and economics was exciting because it allowed us to question and challenge the prevailing assumptions in economics. It turns out that understanding the cognitive processes behind decision-making provides a much richer and more accurate picture of economic behavior than the simplistic models that were prevalent at the time. So, in a sense, that moment was the catalyst for a long and fruitful collaboration that ultimately led to significant contributions to behavioral economics.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a great question. You know, there are several reasons for the slow acceptance of behavioral economics. First, traditional economics has a very strong foundation, and the models are built on assumptions of rationality and self-interest. These ideas are deeply embedded in the academic culture and in the way that economic policy has been formulated. \n\nWhat we found was that challenging those assumptions required not just new evidence, but a shift in how economists thought about human behavior. Many economists were trained to believe in rational agents and didn't see the psychological nuances that we were bringing to the table. \n\nAnother factor is the inertia of intellectual traditions. Once a framework has been established, it tends to persist, even in the face of evidence that contradicts it. It took time for our findings\u2014like those from prospect theory\u2014to be recognized and integrated into the broader economic discourse.\n\nYou know, I think there's also a bit of a social dynamic at play. Behavioral economics was initially seen as somewhat outside the mainstream. It took time for the community to embrace ideas that were viewed as less rigorous or more subjective. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the role of empirical evidence. Behavioral economics has been increasingly supported by robust experimental data over the years, which helps to convince skeptics. But change in academic fields is often slow, and we are still in the process of bridging those gaps. So, in summary, it's a combination of intellectual, social, and empirical factors that explain the delay.",

He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter.

On one hand, there were aspects of economics that could be fine-tuned with psychological insights. For example, the notion of rationality was challenged by understanding cognitive biases, which allowed economists to refine their models. But on the other hand, we did turn some existing theories upside down. \n\nTake prospect theory, for instance. It fundamentally changed how we think about decision-making under risk. Traditional economics assumed that people always make decisions to maximize utility, but our research showed that people actually value gains and losses differently. This was a significant departure from classical economic theory. \n\nSo, while some of our work might have seemed like it was just adding nuances, there were also major shifts in how we understood human behavior and decision-making. It turned out that integrating psychology into economics revealed a much more complicated reality than the neat equations of traditional economics suggested.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them.

You could say that System 1 corresponds to what we often refer to as our \"gut feelings.\" It's the intuitive part of our thinking that responds quickly and automatically, without much conscious effort. On the other hand, System 2, which you might liken to \"your head,\" is the part that engages in more deliberate reasoning and logical analysis. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this is a simplification. The relationship between the two systems is quite complex. System 1 can lead us to make quick judgments that are sometimes correct but can also be biased or flawed. System 2 is supposed to correct those errors, but it often doesn't engage fully or at all. So, while it's fair to use that analogy, it's also essential to appreciate the nuances and limitations of each system.

That's System 1 and it demands a lot of alertness to cues. The 'gut' -- to say System 1 is the gut -- that suggests that there is no thinking there. The best thinking we do is System 1. Creativity is stuff that comes from your memory. It's in that sense System 1. It doesn't work the way we think it works, but it's not that System 2 is more elevated than System 1. Actually, it's...

You know, the way we remember the past significantly influences our expectations and decisions about the future. If you have problems remembering the past accurately, it can lead to a distorted view of what might happen next.\n\nFor instance, if you tend to focus on the most intense moments of your experiences, rather than the overall duration or the entirety of the experience, you might overemphasize the negative or positive aspects of your past. This can create an illusion of how likely those outcomes are to recur. \n\nWhat we found was that people often misjudge their own experiences based on these peak moments, and this can lead to overconfidence in their predictions. It can make you optimistic about future outcomes if you've had a few successes or overly pessimistic if you've experienced significant failures. \n\nMoreover, the Remembering Self is not just keeping score; it's also shaping your narrative, your understanding of who you are and what you're capable of. So, if you're not accurately reflecting on your past, you might develop an unrealistic sense of your abilities or the risks involved in future decisions, whether that be in investing or any other domain. \n\nUltimately, it's a cycle\u2014your flawed memory can lead to flawed expectations, which can further influence your choices and behaviors.

It makes a lot of sense because when things happen we find their causes, and it's OK.

We explain the past with the greatest of ease, and we're really crummy at forecasting the future.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing.

What I would say is that hindsight bias does create a sense of certainty about the past, and that can lead to an illusion of understanding. When we look back and see how events unfolded, it's easy to construct a narrative that seems clear and predictable. However, this does not necessarily translate into optimism about the future.\n\nIn fact, I think it can have the opposite effect. If we believe we understand the past, we might overestimate our ability to predict future events, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence can make us less cautious when facing uncertainty, which is quite dangerous. For example, if we believe we 'knew' the financial crisis was coming, we might conclude that we have the tools to foresee similar events in the future, which is not the case. \n\nIt's important to remember that while we can derive lessons from the past, those lessons are often context-specific and may not apply to future situations. The complexity of the world means that many factors are at play, and our understanding is limited. So, in summary, while hindsight bias may create an illusion of understanding, it doesn't necessarily lead to a more optimistic view of the future.

The idea of scorekeeping is quite compelling, especially when we think about how it could enhance accountability in fields like finance and politics. You know, in baseball, the statistics provide a clear measure of performance, but in many domains, especially those involving human judgment, we lack such precise metrics.\n\nI think one of the areas where we might learn from scorekeeping is in the field of forecasting. For instance, in the realm of political predictions, there have been efforts to create platforms that track the accuracy of predictions over time. This has been done by organizations like the Good Judgement Project, which was based on research showing that certain groups of forecasters can outperform individual experts. They systematically keep track of predictions and their outcomes, which can be incredibly illuminating.\n\nWhat we found was that people often overestimate their predictive abilities, and without a robust scorekeeping system, this overconfidence can go unchecked. In finance, the situation is similar. Many financial analysts make predictions, but there\u2019s very little follow-up on their accuracy or accountability for their advice. \n\nOne of the challenges is that the complexity and uncertainty inherent in these domains make it difficult to create meaningful metrics. Unlike baseball, where the rules are clear and the outcomes measurable, human behavior and market dynamics are influenced by countless unpredictable factors. So, while I believe in the importance of scorekeeping, implementing effective systems in these areas is fraught with difficulties.\n\nIn summary, we could certainly benefit from better scorekeeping mechanisms in finance and politics. They would help us understand the limits of our knowledge, reduce overconfidence, and perhaps lead to better decision-making.

I was giving that advice a lot, and there was one place -- I didn't know it immediately -- somebody took my advice. It was in a financial firm. I won't mention what it was.

Then they told me about it, and we analyzed it. That guy was making well in excess of a million a year, and the conclusion, which I didn't share with anybody, they didn't need him. They could have saved a million dollars. He was adding nothing. That's the kind of thing that people expose themselves to when they keep score. It's a dangerous activity.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a very interesting question. What we found was that the way we evaluate experiences\u2014whether they are pleasurable or painful\u2014often hinges on a few key moments rather than the entire duration of the experience. This is what we call the peak-end rule. Essentially, people tend to remember the most intense moments, either positive or negative, and how the experience concluded.\n\nNow, in terms of structuring experiences to maximize happiness, it seems reasonable to think that if we can create more positive peaks or ensure a pleasant ending, we might enhance our overall satisfaction. However, it's important to remember that our memories can be quite deceptive. The remembering self does not always align with the experiencing self. So, while deliberately structuring experiences might lead to better evaluations afterward, it\u2019s not a straightforward task.\n\nMoreover, there's an inherent uncertainty in predicting how certain structures will affect our happiness. People are not always aware of their biases, and the complexity of human emotions makes it challenging to design experiences that universally lead to greater happiness. \n\nSo, in summary, while there are strategies we might employ to enhance our experiences, I would caution against overconfidence in our ability to predict their effects. It's worth experimenting, but we should also be mindful of the limitations of our understanding.",

So ends are very important for memories.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's an interesting question. You know, people often don't structure their vacations in a way that maximizes their overall happiness. They tend to focus on the anticipation and the planning stages, which can be enjoyable, but they may overlook the importance of how the vacation actually ends. \n\nWhat we found was that many individuals will emphasize activities that are exciting or novel, but they might neglect to consider how they'll feel at the end of the trip. This disconnect can lead to what I would call a market failure. People might choose destinations or experiences that they believe will be enjoyable, but they don't account for the fact that the memory of a vacation is heavily influenced by its conclusion.\n\nIn some ways, if they listened to the insights from our research, they could potentially design their vacations better. They might prioritize experiences that ensure a more satisfying ending, like including downtime or enjoyable activities at the end. But, you know, changing behavior is difficult. Even if people understand the importance of good endings, it doesn't guarantee that they'll act on that knowledge. Human decision-making is complicated, and we often fall prey to biases that lead us to make choices that don\u2019t align with what we know would improve our happiness.",
