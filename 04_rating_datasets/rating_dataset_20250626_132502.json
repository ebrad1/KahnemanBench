          "response_text": "Well, yes, that's a fundamental distinction in how we understand human thinking. We typically refer to this as System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast, automatic, and often emotional. It operates effortlessly and is responsible for our quick judgments and decisions. This is where you find those intuitive responses\u2014like the bat and ball problem you mentioned, where the quick answer feels right but is, in fact, wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and more analytical. It requires effort and concentration, and it kicks in when we encounter problems that need more thought, like complex mathematical calculations or critical evaluations of evidence. \n\nWhat we find is that people often rely too heavily on System 1, especially in situations where they should engage System 2. This reliance can lead to biases and errors. For instance, if you're faced with a question that seems straightforward, your intuitive answer might come quickly, and you might not feel the need to check your work. This is a manifestation of what we call overconfidence, where people are convinced they're right without validating their answers.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the interplay between these two systems is not just about speed; it's also about the context and the nature of the task at hand. Some problems trigger System 1 responses because they are familiar or seem simple, while others, perhaps more complex or unfamiliar, prompt us to engage System 2. But, of course, the challenge is that even when we know we should think more slowly, we often don't.",

The assumptions of rationality and selfishness in economic theory seemed overly simplistic and, frankly, not reflective of human behavior as I understood it. My colleague, who was an economist, was interested in decision-making, and he thought I could contribute something from psychology.\n\nWhat happened next was a series of discussions with Amos Tversky, who became my close collaborator. We began to explore how people actually make decisions under uncertainty, and that led to the development of prospect theory. It turns out that people's choices often contradict the predictions of classical economics due to various cognitive biases and heuristics. We showed that people are not always rational and that they value potential losses more than equivalent gains, which was a significant departure from the traditional view.\n\nThis work opened up a new field\u2014behavioral economics\u2014where we could integrate psychological insights into economic models. It was a fascinating journey, and I think we were both surprised by the impact our research had on understanding economic behavior. It also highlighted the limitations of purely mathematical approaches to human decision-making, which is something I still believe is crucial to recognize today.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a good question, and I think it has several facets. First, you have to consider that the foundational ideas in economics, particularly those concerning rationality and utility maximization, were deeply entrenched. They provided a clean, elegant model that was appealing to many. Challenging those ideas is not something that happens overnight; it requires a substantial body of evidence and an alternative framework.\n\nWhat we found was that, while traditional economics assumed that people are rational agents, the reality is much messier. Human beings are influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, and social factors, which often lead to decisions that deviate from the rational model. It took a lot of empirical work to demonstrate these deviations convincingly.\n\nMoreover, the academic culture in economics tends to favor models that are mathematically rigorous, and behavioral insights can sometimes feel messy or less precise. This tension between rigor and the complexity of human behavior has slowed the acceptance of behavioral economics.\n\nI also think that the influence of prominent figures, particularly in the last decade, has played a crucial role. As more researchers began to publish work that integrated psychological insights into economic theory, it gained traction. The work of people like Richard Thaler, for example, has been instrumental in bringing behavioral economics into the mainstream.\n\nSo, in summary, it took time because of the strength of the traditional paradigm, the need for substantial evidence, and the gradual shift in academic culture. It\u2019s a process that continues to evolve, and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re at the end of it yet.",

          "response_text": "Well, it was brought as a series of challenges. The person who really created behavioral economics is Richard Thaler, who is an economist. He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter.

What we found was that traditional economics often relied on assumptions about rational decision-making that simply didn't reflect how people actually behave. The introduction of psychological insights revealed that human judgment is influenced by biases, heuristics, and emotional factors, which are not accounted for in classical models.\n\nSo, on one hand, we were refining existing theories by demonstrating how people deviate from the rational agent model through phenomena like loss aversion and framing effects. On the other hand, these insights fundamentally challenged the assumptions underlying economic theory. It turned out that the behavior of individuals in economic contexts is much more complex than the standard models suggested.\n\nFor example, prospect theory, which I developed with Amos Tversky, showed that people value gains and losses differently, leading to decisions that often contradict the predictions of classical economics. This was a significant shift, and it forced economists to reconsider their models and incorporate a more realistic view of human behavior. So, I would say it was a mix of both fine-tuning and turning things upside down, with profound implications for the field.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them.

You could say that System 1 represents our intuitive, emotional responses\u2014our \"gut\" feelings, if you will. It's fast and often operates without our conscious awareness. System 2, on the other hand, is more analytical, reflecting our \"head\" in the sense that it involves reasoning and deliberation. \n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that System 1 is not just about emotions; it also encompasses a range of automatic processes, including pattern recognition and heuristics. System 2, while it can provide rational thought, is also limited by our cognitive resources and can be quite lazy, as I mentioned. So, while the gut versus head analogy captures some of the essence, it oversimplifies the complexity of how these systems interact and influence our decisions. \n\nWhat we found was that many of our decisions are made quickly by System 1, and System 2 often comes in afterward to justify those decisions. This can lead to overconfidence in our reasoning, which is a significant bias we need to be aware of. So, yes, it's a fair starting point, but there's more depth to it than just gut versus head.",

If you're not accurately recalling those peaks or the way experiences concluded, you might have an overly optimistic or pessimistic view of what to expect next. \n\nFor instance, in investing, if you remember your biggest losses more than your gains, you might become overly risk-averse in the future, even if the overall experience was positive. Conversely, if you remember only the highs, you might take unwarranted risks. \n\nThis misalignment can lead to what we call the \"illusion of understanding.\" You might think you have a grasp on how to navigate future decisions based on a faulty recollection of past experiences. It\u2019s a bit of a trap, really, because without accurate memories, you\u2019re not equipped to make the best decisions moving forward. \n\nSo, in essence, if your memories are skewed, that can lead to misguided expectations and potentially poor choices, which is really quite unfortunate.",

Hindsight bias certainly gives us the illusion that events were more predictable than they actually were, and I think that can create a certain sense of confidence about the future. When we believe we understand the past, it can lead us to think that the future is also knowable, which can indeed foster optimism.\n\nHowever, I would caution that this optimism is often misplaced. There\u2019s a big difference between our ability to explain past events and our ability to predict future ones. You know, the cognitive biases that affect our judgment don\u2019t just make us overconfident about what we know; they can also distort our expectations about future events. \n\nFor instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, many people felt that they had understood the signs in retrospect, but in reality, the complexity of the financial system and the numerous variables involved made it extremely difficult to predict. So, while hindsight bias might give us a false sense of security and lead to optimism, I think it\u2019s important to remain aware of the limitations of our understanding and the unpredictability of the future.\n\nWhat we often find is that this overconfidence can result in poor decision-making, because it leads us to underestimate risks and overestimate our ability to manage uncertainty.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing.

Scorekeeping is indeed crucial in many fields, and it serves to provide accountability and clarity. In the financial world, we have some mechanisms that attempt to track performance, but they often fall short of what you might call a rigorous scoring system. \n\nOne example that comes to mind is the way we assess fund managers. Performance is often measured relative to a benchmark, but this can lead to a focus on short-term results rather than long-term value creation. The performance metrics can sometimes be misleading due to biases, such as overconfidence or hindsight bias. \n\nIn politics, the situation is even murkier. We have various metrics, such as approval ratings, but they don't capture the full impact of policies or the complexities of governance. There's a tendency to simplify issues, leading to a failure to hold leaders accountable in a meaningful way. \n\nYou know, what we found was that the lack of a consistent and transparent method of scorekeeping can lead to a disconnect between actions and consequences. It's much easier to measure outcomes in fields like sports or medicine, where the results can be directly observed and quantified. In finance and politics, the outcomes are often influenced by a myriad of factors, making it difficult to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships.\n\nSo, I think there\u2019s a lot we could learn from more rigorous scorekeeping practices in other fields, but implementing that in finance and politics is quite challenging.

I was giving that advice a lot, and there was one place -- I didn't know it immediately -- somebody took my advice. It was in a financial firm. I won't mention what it was. For a year, he kept track of every decision he made and the options he considered and rejected. There was a fair amount of material collected by the end of the year. Then they told me about it, and we analyzed it. That guy was making well in excess of a million a year, and the conclusion, which I didn't share with anybody, they didn't need him. They could have saved a million dollars. He was adding nothing. That's the kind of thing that people expose themselves to when they keep score. It's a dangerous activity.",

For instance, if you're planning a vacation, you might want to ensure that the last day is particularly enjoyable or that there are memorable highlights throughout.\n\nHowever, there are some caveats. First, not everyone is equally skilled at predicting what will make them happy. There\u2019s a tendency toward overconfidence in our ability to forecast our emotional responses. Second, we should also consider the trade-offs. What you might gain in happiness from structuring experiences could come at the cost of spontaneity or authenticity.\n\nUltimately, while I think it can be beneficial to think about how we structure our experiences, I would also caution against over-engineering happiness. Life is complex, and there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about what truly brings satisfaction.

However, the reality is much more complicated. \n\nWhat we found was that human decision-making is profoundly influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics. These are not just minor errors; they can lead to significant deviations from what traditional economics would consider rational behavior. For instance, in experiments, we\u2019ve seen how people are influenced by framing effects, where the way a problem is presented can lead to different decisions, even when the underlying information is the same. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to clarify that when we talk about irrationality, it doesn\u2019t mean that people are always irrational or that they lack logic entirely. Rather, it's about the fact that our thinking processes are often governed by System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional, rather than System 2, which is slow and deliberative. \n\nSo, while economics and other fields have been built on the assumption of rationality, the empirical evidence suggests that human behavior is far more complex. This doesn\u2019t invalidate the notion of rationality; it simply highlights its limitations. We're not as rational as we like to think, and acknowledging that can lead to better models and a deeper understanding of human behavior.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that the insights from behavioral economics can enhance our understanding of rationality rather than diminish it.

For example, the illusion of understanding led many investors and financial professionals to underestimate the risks involved in complex financial products. This was a classic case of overconfidence, which is something we know quite a bit about from our research.\n\nSo, in that sense, you could argue that there was a kind of collective behavior that was not purely rational.

It operates quickly and efficiently, often based on heuristics that we\u2019ve developed over time.\n\nNow, when we engage in System 2 thinking, that effortful deliberation, it stands out precisely because it\u2019s so rare. We tend to notice and remember instances of deep thought, particularly because they are often accompanied by a sense of struggle or conflict. This leads to an overestimation of how often we engage in such thinking. We might imagine ourselves as more deliberative than we actually are, and that's partly due to the vividness of those experiences in our memory.\n\nWhat we found in our research is that people are often not aware of how much they rely on intuitive judgments. For example, in situations where they might think they are being rational and thorough, they are, in fact, largely dependent on automatic responses. This disconnect between the perceived frequency of effortful thinking and its actual prevalence can lead to overconfidence in our cognitive abilities.\n\nSo, the paradox is that while we value and pay attention to effortful thinking, it is not as common as we believe.

They\u2019re rooted in who are the people that you trusted and what they seemed to believe in, and it has very little to do with the reasons that come to your mind, why your position is correct and the position of the other side is nonsensical.

The distinction between rationality and logic is quite relevant, particularly in the context of how we understand decision-making and judgment. You know, when we think about rationality, we often envision a standard of judgment that implies a certain correctness or a clear set of rules. In practice, however, human beings frequently operate under a different set of principles, driven more by intuition and emotions than by logical reasoning.\n\nIt turns out that our cognitive processes are deeply influenced by heuristics and biases, which means that our conclusions often precede our reasoning. For instance, you might feel strongly about a political issue, and that emotional response can shape your reasoning in ways that feel rational to you, but may not hold up under scrutiny. This is where the work of Amos Tversky and myself in developing prospect theory comes into play. We found that people evaluate outcomes not just on final results but on perceived gains and losses, which can lead to seemingly irrational decisions.\n\nSo, when you say we're not logical creatures, I think that reflects a reality of human cognition. We often construct narratives to make sense of our experiences, which can lead us to overlook the inherent uncertainty in the world. Recognizing that our minds are not wired for strict logic can help us approach disagreements with more understanding, rather than frustration. It's about accepting the limitations of our reasoning processes and the role that emotions and biases play in shaping our beliefs.",

The experiencing self and the remembering self do not operate in a straightforward hierarchy; rather, they interact in complex ways. \n\nWhat we found was that the remembering self often has a disproportionate influence on our choices and evaluations. For example, when we think about a vacation, it\u2019s not necessarily the sum of all the moments we experienced that shapes our recollection, but rather the most intense moments and how the experience ended. This is the essence of the peak-end rule.\n\nHowever, the experiencing self is crucial in the moment. It\u2019s the one that feels pleasure or pain, and it\u2019s often overlooked when we make decisions. There are situations where the experiencing self can dominate\u2014like in a moment of acute pain or joy\u2014but in the long run, when we reflect on our lives, it\u2019s the remembering self that often drives our decisions. \n\nSo, I would say it\u2019s not a matter of one always trumping the other. It\u2019s more about the context and the nature of the decision being made. Sometimes, we prioritize what we have lived through, and sometimes, we rely on our memories, which can be biased and selective. Our choices are a product of this dynamic interplay, and it can lead to some surprising outcomes. \n\nUltimately, understanding these two selves helps us appreciate the complexities of human decision-making, but I must emphasize that there\u2019s still much we don\u2019t know about how these processes unfold in different contexts.",

But then there is another way of measuring well-being, which is to stop people and to ask them to think about their life and to say whether their life is good or bad. It's completely different.

In the case of childbirth, the intense pain might be forgotten or minimized when we think about the outcome: the birth of a child. This is a classic demonstration of how our memories can be biased, leading us to believe that the experience was more positive than it truly was.\n\nThis dynamic contributes to a broader illusion of comprehensibility. We construct narratives that impose a sense of order and meaning on our experiences, which may not reflect the chaotic nature of reality. Our memories, shaped by biases and heuristics, can lead us to conclude that the world makes sense when, in fact, it often does not. It's a comforting illusion, I suppose, but it can also be misleading.\n\nSo, Tippett's connection to these philosophical implications is intriguing, and it raises questions about how we engage with our past and how that shapes our understanding of the world.

The reason is that overconfidence leads to a host of poor decisions, both at the individual and societal levels. \n\nWhat we found was that people tend to overestimate their abilities, their knowledge, and the precision of their predictions. For instance, studies have shown that when you ask people to predict their performance on various tasks, they typically believe they will perform better than average, which is statistically impossible for most tasks. This overconfidence can lead to significant errors in judgment.\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the paradox you mentioned. Overconfidence can also be a driving force in entrepreneurship and innovation. Entrepreneurs often take risks that others would not, and this can lead to breakthroughs and economic growth. So, there\u2019s this duality: overconfidence can lead to catastrophic failures, but it can also foster creativity and ambition. \n\nMy guess is that the key lies in managing overconfidence rather than eliminating it entirely. It\u2019s about finding a balance\u2014encouraging the boldness that drives progress while also instilling a sense of humility that can prevent the kinds of disasters we\u2019ve seen throughout history. \n\nUltimately, the challenge is to make people aware of their limitations and the uncertainty inherent in their judgments.

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision.

So, if something is more readily available in memory, we assume it\u2019s more common or likely.\n\nNow, the phrase 'What you see is all there is' encapsulates this idea beautifully. It highlights a critical limitation in our thinking: we simply do not have access to the full range of information. Our judgments and decisions are severely constrained by what is easily retrievable from memory. This can lead to overconfidence in our beliefs and a tendency to ignore evidence that contradicts our current understanding.\n\nFor instance, consider expert disagreement. Experts in a field may have access to different pieces of information or may prioritize different data, leading them to different conclusions. But if they are operating under the assumption that their perspective is the only one supported by evidence, they may overlook alternative viewpoints or the broader context. \n\nIn many ways, this limitation is part of the broader challenge of human judgment. We simply don't know what we don't know, and that can lead to significant errors in decision-making.

You know, when I think about consciousness, I often come back to the distinction between the experiencing self and the remembering self, which is something I explored in my work. The experiencing self is engaged in the moment, while the remembering self constructs narratives based on those experiences. This interplay is crucial to understanding how we make decisions and evaluate our lives.\n\nIn terms of fast and slow thinking, I think about how much of our cognitive processing happens outside of our conscious awareness. System 1 operates automatically and quickly; it doesn\u2019t require much effort or conscious thought. System 2, on the other hand, is where our conscious reasoning happens, but it\u2019s often slower and more demanding. So, there\u2019s a kind of hierarchy in how we engage with consciousness, depending on the demands of the situation.\n\nNow, regarding AI and consciousness, I must admit I\u2019m not an expert in that field. However, I can say that our understanding of consciousness is still quite limited. It turns out that we know very little about the mechanisms underlying our own consciousness, let alone how it might manifest in machines. The philosophical debates around this, I think, often highlight our uncertainty more than they clarify.\n\nThere's also the question of whether consciousness is necessary for certain types of decision-making. Many of our biases and errors occur without us being fully aware of them. This raises interesting questions about the nature of consciousness itself. Is it merely a byproduct of our cognitive processes, or does it serve a more fundamental role?\n\nIn essence, I don\u2019t have a definitive answer. My guess is that consciousness is a complex interplay of various cognitive processes, and while we can study its effects and implications, the underlying nature remains somewhat mysterious.

Many of our decisions are made with System 1, and it's not until we engage System 2 that we start to question our initial thoughts. This doesn't mean that we will always arrive at a different conclusion, but rather that we can become aware of our biases and the limitations of our reasoning.\n\nIn practice, thinking again is about fostering a mindset where we are willing to pause and reassess, rather than simply defending our original positions. It\u2019s a kind of cognitive humility, which I believe is crucial in both personal and professional contexts. \n\nNow, the challenge, of course, is that self-improvement in this area is difficult.

You know, when we talk about errors in decision-making, it's crucial to distinguish between biases, which are systematic deviations from rationality, and noise, which is random variability in judgments. \n\nWhat we found was that noise can be just as detrimental, if not more so, than bias in many situations. Bias is often about the direction of an error, whereas noise is about inconsistency. For example, if two doctors evaluate the same medical case, bias might lead one to overestimate the severity of an illness due to prior experiences, while noise could mean that one doctor is more lenient than the other, resulting in different diagnoses that aren't systematically biased, just random.\n\nThis distinction is important because addressing bias alone may not be sufficient to improve decision-making. We also need to tackle noise, which is often invisible and underestimated. In organizations, for instance, noise can lead to wildly different outcomes based on who is making the decision. So, my concern is that by focusing predominantly on bias, we might be neglecting a significant and potentially more pervasive issue in how we understand human error. \n\nIt's a nuanced area, and I certainly don't have all the answers, but I think it's an important conversation to have as we move forward in understanding human judgment.",

What we found was that when people evaluate painful experiences, they seem to focus primarily on the peak intensity of the pain and the end of the experience, rather than its overall duration. This is what we call the peak-end rule.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it might make sense that we focus on the most intense moments and how experiences conclude because these are the aspects that could influence our future behavior. For instance, if you have a painful medical procedure, what you remember most is likely the worst part of it and how it ended, which could shape your decisions about similar procedures in the future.\n\nDuration neglect can be somewhat counterintuitive because, intuitively, we might think that longer experiences should feel worse overall. However, our memories are not perfect records; they are reconstructive. What happens is that the memory of an experience is not necessarily a linear function of its duration. Instead, the emotional peaks and the final moments are weighted more heavily.\n\nYou could argue that this has practical implications. If we want to design experiences, whether they be medical treatments or vacations, we should think about how to minimize the peak pain and ensure a positive ending. But I should note that while these insights can be useful, human behavior is complex, and there are many factors at play. It's not a simple formula.",

What we found in our research using the Day Reconstruction Method is indeed that people report significantly higher levels of happiness when they spend time with friends compared to many other activities. However, the question of why they don't optimize for that is complex.\n\nFirst, it's important to recognize that people are often constrained by other factors\u2014work obligations, family responsibilities, or even just the sheer logistics of organizing social gatherings. These constraints can lead to a kind of mismatch between what people enjoy and what they actually do. \n\nMoreover, there\u2019s the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is quick and intuitive, often leading people to make decisions based on immediate context or available choices rather than a deeper consideration of overall happiness. So, someone might prioritize an urgent work task over socializing with friends, even if they know, on some level, that they would enjoy the latter more.\n\nThen there's the concept of \"duration neglect,\" which suggests that people don't accurately assess the happiness derived from experiences based on their duration. So, while a long evening with friends might seem appealing, the immediate demands of life can overshadow that potential joy.\n\nFinally, there's the issue of social norms and expectations. People often feel pressure to conform to societal standards about how they should spend their time, which can lead them to prioritize other activities that may not bring as much happiness. \n\nSo, in summary, while the data suggests that socializing brings greater happiness, the reality of human decision-making is influenced by a multitude of factors\u2014logistical, cognitive, and social\u2014that can lead to choices that don't maximize happiness in the way we might expect.",

It turns out that while people may be informed about the distinction between experiential happiness and life satisfaction, changing their behavior is much more challenging. You know, we often overestimate the extent to which people can modify their decision-making based on new information. \n\nFor instance, consider the research on cognitive biases. People are quite resistant to changing their fundamental patterns of thinking and behavior, even when they have access to insights that could theoretically lead to better outcomes. They tend to stick to what they know, which is often guided by their existing beliefs and experiences. \n\nOne of the key findings from our work was that people are generally not very good at predicting what will make them happy. There\u2019s a tendency to focus on material gains or achievements, believing they will lead to satisfaction. However, when it comes to actual happiness, social relationships and experiences often play a more significant role. \n\nSo, while it\u2019s certainly possible to nudge people towards more informed choices\u2014like prioritizing experiences over material goods\u2014it's a gradual process, and the effectiveness can vary widely among individuals. Change often requires more than just information; it may involve altering the context in which decisions are made, which is a more complicated endeavor. \n\nIn essence, I would say that while insights from psychological research can inform behavior, they do not automatically translate into change.

What we found was that people tend to feel the pain of losses much more acutely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. \n\nIn this scenario, the one minute feels like a minor inconvenience, while two hours feels like a significant loss of time and opportunity.

This is similar to how music influences our emotional experience of a movie. It can evoke feelings and set the tone, even if it doesn't alter the narrative itself.\n\nHowever, I think it's crucial to differentiate between biases that enrich our experiences and those that lead to errors in judgment. Some biases can indeed enhance our lives\u2014like the joy of rooting for a team or the pleasure of music\u2014but others can be detrimental, leading us to make poor decisions or misinterpret situations.\n\nWhat we found in our research is that while biases are part of the human experience, they also come with a cost.

It allows us to appreciate the richness they bring while also recognizing the potential pitfalls they present. \n\nIn essence, I don't think we can simply label biases as positive or negative.

Traditionally, we focused a lot on biases\u2014those systematic deviations from rationality that can lead to poor decision-making.

For instance, in a study we conducted with an insurance company, we looked at how different underwriters evaluated the same set of claims. The differences in their assessments were often much larger than the differences attributable to bias. This variability can lead to inconsistent decisions, which is problematic because it means that two equally qualified individuals might arrive at very different conclusions based solely on random variation.\n\nYou know, it's somewhat humbling to realize that even the best professionals can be subject to this kind of randomness. It\u2019s not just about what they know or how they think; it's also about the inherent noise in the system.

And it's true within individuals, but it's especially true among individuals who are supposed to be interchangeable in, say, organizations. I'll tell you where the experiment from which my current fascination with noise arose. I was working with an insurance company, and we did a very standard experiment. They constructed cases, very routine, standard cases. Expensive cases \u2014 we're not talking of insuring cars. We're talking of insuring financial firms for risk of fraud. So you have people who are specialists in this. This is what they do. Cases were constructed completely realistically, the kind of thing that people encounter every day. You have 50 people reading a case and putting a dollar value on it. I could ask you, and I asked the executives in the firm, and it's a number that just about everybody agrees. Suppose you take two people at random, two underwriters at random. You average the premium they set, you take the difference between them, and you divide the difference by the average. By what percentage do people differ? Well, would you expect people to differ? And there is a common answer that you find, when I just talk to people and ask them, or the executives had the same answer. It's somewhere around 10 percent. That's what people expect to see in a well-run firm. Now, what we found was 50 percent, 5\u20130, which, by the way, means that those underwriters were absolutely wasting their time, in the sense of assessing risk. So that's noise, and you find variability across individuals, which is not supposed to exist. And you find variability within individuals, depending morning, afternoon, hot, cold. A lot of things influence the way that people make judgments: whether they are full, or whether they've had lunch or haven't had lunch affects the judges, and things like that. Now, it's hard to say what there is more of, noise or bias. But one thing is very certain \u2014 that bias has been overestimated at the expense of noise. Virtually all the literature and a lot of public conversation is about biases. But in fact, noise is, I think, extremely important, very prevalent. There is an interesting fact \u2014 that noise and bias are independent sources of error, so that reducing either of them improves overall accuracy. There is room for . . . and the procedures by which you would reduce bias and reduce noise are not the same. So that's what I'm fascinated by these days.",

If you take a group of auditors and they all have similar biases or share the same information, the aggregation won't necessarily reduce noise; it might simply reinforce those biases.\n\nWhat we found was that aggregation can help when there is a certain level of independence in judgments. You can achieve this through anonymous voting or by using statistical methods to weight their contributions appropriately. But if noise is systematic and pervasive among the group, simply averaging their opinions may not help much.\n\nSo, while the wisdom of crowds has potential, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with caution.

You would be left with bias, but you would eliminate one source of error, and the question is just price.

In situations where you can't average the judgments of multiple people, there are still strategies that can help reduce noise in decision-making. One key approach is to deliberately delay intuition. This means taking a moment to step back and reflect before making a decision, rather than relying on that immediate gut feeling. \n\nYou know, I often think about my ongoing discussion with Gary Klein on this topic. He emphasizes the value of expert intuition, and while I appreciate his perspective, I tend to be more cautious about it. Intuition can be quite powerful, but it is also very prone to biases and noise. \n\nWhat we found was that structured decision-making processes can help. For example, a CEO might consider using checklists or frameworks to evaluate options systematically. This can help ensure that important factors are not overlooked and that decisions are made more consistently.\n\nAdditionally, it can be useful to gather feedback from trusted advisors or even external experts who can provide a fresh perspective. The challenge is to create an environment where dissenting opinions are welcomed, as this can help to counteract the noise that comes from overconfidence or groupthink.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create a decision-making culture that values reflection and rigor, even at the individual level.

Delaying intuition until the facts are in, at hand, and looking at dimensions of the problem separately and independently is a better use of information. The problem with intuition is that it forms very quickly, so that you need to have special procedures in place to control it except in those rare cases \u2014 and Gary Klein and others have demonstrated that \u2014 where you have intuitive expertise. That's true for athletes \u2014 they respond intuitively. It's true for chess masters. It's true for firefighters, captains, as Gary Klein has shown. So that's intuitive expertise.

These traits don't fit cleanly into the categories of bias or noise. Instead, they reflect differences in cognitive functioning that can impact how information is processed and how decisions are made.\n\nWhat we found in our work is that biases and noise are primarily about deviations from optimal decision-making in specific contexts. In contrast, conditions like ADHD can fundamentally alter the way individuals engage with those contexts. So, I would argue that cognitive disabilities represent a different logical category, one that deserves its own consideration alongside biases and noise.\n\nMoreover, it's important to acknowledge that this is an area where I feel some uncertainty.

Cognitive biases are often the result of heuristics that guide our decision-making processes, sometimes leading us astray. For instance, we might have a bias against risk that affects our decision to sell a kidney, which we perceive as a morally repugnant transaction.\n\nOn the other hand, moral intuitions are more deeply rooted in our values and social norms. They often arise from our experiences and the cultural context we live in. When people react strongly against kidney markets, it\u2019s not merely a cognitive bias; it\u2019s also about what they believe is right or wrong. There's a kind of moral reasoning at play that transcends straightforward biases.\n\nWhat we find is that people\u2019s discomfort often stems from feelings of fairness, dignity, and the sanctity of the human body. These feelings can be very powerful and are not easily categorized within traditional cognitive frameworks. In fact, they can lead to significant social and political consequences, as we see in debates surrounding organ donation and markets.\n\nSo, while there are elements of bias in how we process information about these transactions, the strong moral reactions likely come from a different place altogether. They reflect our ethical frameworks and the way we relate to one another as social beings. It\u2019s a complex interplay, and I don't think we can reduce it to bias alone.",

We may find ourselves in a situation where humans are needed to oversee, interpret, and make decisions based on what machines produce. \n\nSo, my guess is that while many jobs will change or disappear, there will always be a role for humans, particularly in areas requiring complex decision-making and interpersonal skills. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this is an ongoing process, and the future is inherently uncertain.",

When I look back at my early work, particularly in visual perception and attention, I see a foundation that, in some ways, is quite connected to my later research on biases and decision-making. My early studies were very much about how people perceive the world, how we attend to different stimuli, and how our cognitive processes can be quite flawed.\n\nFor example, the work on attention highlighted the limitations of our perceptual systems. It turns out that we are often blind to things that are right in front of us if we're focused on something else. This idea of selective attention resonates with the cognitive biases that I later explored with Amos Tversky. We found that people often rely on mental shortcuts that can lead them astray\u2014much like how our attention can mislead us in perception.\n\nThe Israeli bus drivers study, which looked at their decision-making regarding work schedules and fatigue, was another step in this evolution. It illustrated how people make choices under uncertainty and the biases that influence those choices. What we found was that the same cognitive flaws we observe in controlled experiments are present in real-world decision-making, affecting how people manage their time and energy.\n\nSo, I would say that my early work laid the groundwork for understanding the mechanics of thought processes. While there were certainly leaps along the way\u2014particularly when collaborating with Tversky that led to prospect theory\u2014there is a continuity in exploring how the mind works and how these mechanisms influence our judgments and decisions.

The distinction between System 1 and System 2 is fundamentally about two modes of thinking: the intuitive, fast responses of System 1 and the more deliberative, slower processes of System 2. This framework is more about the structure of our cognitive processes than about specific findings that may or may not replicate.\n\nIt's important to recognize that the replication crisis has raised serious questions about many specific findings in psychology, including some of the biases we identified. However, the core idea of System 1 and System 2 remains intact, as it is about how we think rather than the accuracy of particular experiments. \n\nWhat we found was that these two systems operate differently and that they interact in complex ways. Even if certain experimental results don't replicate, that doesn't necessarily undermine the validity of the distinction itself. It is possible that the mechanisms underlying these systems are still valid even if specific manifestations of biases are less robust than we initially thought.\n\nThat said, I don't want to downplay the implications of replication failures. They highlight the need for caution and humility in our conclusions. We have to be careful about overgeneralizing from findings that may be fragile. In the end, while the System 1 and System 2 framework is a useful lens for understanding human cognition, we must continually test and refine our understanding based on new evidence.

There is some evidence suggesting that bilingualism can lead to enhanced cognitive flexibility.

This is likely because managing two languages involves a constant practice of inhibiting one language while using another, which can strengthen those mental faculties.\n\nHowever, I should also mention that the effects can vary widely depending on the context in which the languages are used. The advantages aren't universal and can depend on factors such as how proficient one is in each language and the frequency of use. \n\nThere's a lot of ongoing research in this area, and while some findings are promising, I would be cautious about overgeneralizing.

The reliance on these traditional models can create a kind of bias\u2014an overconfidence in their own rationality and in the rationality of their patients.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the training for these professionals often emphasizes medical knowledge and technical skills, sometimes at the expense of understanding human behavior in a nuanced way.

In contrast, real-world driving is filled with unpredictability and subtle cues. For example, a human driver can intuitively understand a policeman's gestures or the nuances of a child's behavior in the street, but those types of social cues are incredibly challenging for an AI to interpret correctly.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s the problem of overconfidence in AI systems. People often underestimate the complexity of human judgment and the subtleties of real-world environments. We tend to think that because AI performs well in controlled conditions, it will easily translate that success to all scenarios, which is not the case. \n\nAnd there's also the issue of cognitive biases. When we assess the progress of AI, we might suffer from an illusion of understanding, believing that these systems are closer to solving complex problems than they actually are. So, while we may see advancements, they might not be as substantial as we hope, leading to a local optimum situation where further improvement becomes disproportionately harder.\n\nIn short, the obstacles involve not only technical challenges but also our understanding of human-like reasoning and the unpredictable nature of the environment in which these systems must operate.

One of the most striking aspects of AI is its struggle with what we might call \"common sense.\" AI can process vast amounts of data and perform specific tasks with remarkable efficiency, yet it often fails in situations that require a nuanced understanding of context or human experience.\n\nWhat it reveals to us is how deeply embedded common sense is in human cognition\u2014it's something we often take for granted. For instance, when we encounter a scenario that requires us to infer intentions or navigate social dynamics, we rely on a kind of intuitive understanding that is difficult to articulate and even harder to program into machines. \n\nMoreover, the way AI handles ambiguity and uncertainty highlights our cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Humans can make judgments in situations with incomplete information, often relying on heuristics and biases, as we discussed in our work with Tversky. In contrast, AI systems may struggle with these kinds of decisions because they are not designed to operate in ambiguity\u2014they require clear data and parameters.\n\nSo, in a way, the shortcomings of AI expose the complexity of human thought processes, particularly the aspects that are not easily quantifiable or reducible to algorithms. It turns out that common sense is not just a simple collection of facts but a rich tapestry of experiences and intuitive judgments that are foundational to human interaction and decision-making.

And I think people, by and large, would be better off without regret. But notice what regret is. Regret is what happens the next morning. And if we didn't have it, then who knows what we might do.",

On one hand, it can serve as a social regulator. It can help us conform to social norms and maintain relationships. In that sense, it can promote beneficial behaviors. However, it also has a darker side. Excessive shame can lead to withdrawal, depression, and even aggression. So, my view is that shame can have utility in moderation, but it can also be destructive if it becomes pervasive. It really depends on the context and the individual. \n\nAs for counterfactual thinking and happiness, it turns out that this is also quite nuanced. Counterfactual thinking involves imagining how things could have been different. It can lead to feelings of regret or relief, and these feelings can significantly impact our happiness. Research suggests that people often engage in counterfactual thinking after negative events, which can enhance feelings of regret and dissatisfaction. However, it can also provide a learning opportunity\u2014if you reflect on what could have been done differently, it can lead to better decisions in the future. So, the impact on happiness varies depending on how we engage with those counterfactuals. \n\nIn summary, both shame and counterfactual thinking have their pros and cons, and their effects on individuals can vary widely.",

Recognition-primed decision-making, as you know, is a framework that highlights how experts often rely on their experiences to make quick decisions in familiar situations. It turns out that this can be quite effective, especially when time is limited. However, it's crucial to recognize that even experts are not immune to cognitive biases.\n\nAvailability bias, for instance, can influence what comes to mind when making a decision. If you've had particularly vivid experiences, those might overshadow other relevant information. Confirmation bias can also creep in, leading experts to favor information that supports their prior beliefs while disregarding evidence to the contrary. So, in practice, even seasoned practitioners using recognition-primed decision-making may still be affected by these biases, often without realizing it.\n\nI think recognition-primed decision-making remains a valuable strategy, particularly in high-pressure situations. However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations. It\u2019s not a panacea. In some contexts, where the stakes are high and the environment is uncertain, taking a step back and engaging in more deliberate thinking\u2014what I call System 2 thinking\u2014might be necessary to mitigate those biases.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about knowing when to trust your intuition and when to question it.

Gary Klein and I became friends over a period of six years when we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? I'm sort of a critic of intuition, and he is very much in favor of intuition, of expert intuition. And we were trying to find out, what are the boundaries? Because it's clear that sometimes intuition is wonderful and sometimes it's awful. We ended up with a fairly obvious set of conclusions about what it is. You're going to have Gary Klein\u2013type intuition, expert intuition, if you have a regular world. That's condition number one. There are regularities that you can pick up.

If you have those three conditions, which are true for chess players \u2014 and they're true for spouses recognizing the emotion of their spouse on the telephone, to give you a completely different example \u2014 then intuition will develop and it will be perfect.

In five to ten years, it\u2019s possible that new insights could emerge that challenge my current views, perhaps through advancements in neuroscience or psychology that we cannot yet foresee.\n\nAs for social science more broadly, I think we often underestimate the influence of cultural and contextual factors on behavior.

In the next decade, we may discover that many of the heuristics and biases we've identified don\u2019t hold universally, or that they interact in unexpected ways with cultural variables.\n\nI suppose my overarching belief is that intellectual humility is essential.

One reason is that social psychology, like many fields, had a strong emphasis on theoretical frameworks that were very appealing and often seemed intuitively correct. Researchers were often focused on creating novel and exciting findings, which might overshadow the need for rigorous replication.\n\nAlso, the incentive structures in academia tend to favor novel discoveries over replication studies. There is a kind of prestige associated with publishing original work, which can lead to less attention being paid to the verification of existing results. My guess is that this is a systemic issue across many disciplines, but it may have been particularly pronounced in social psychology.\n\nIt turns out that the culture of the field allowed for a lack of scrutiny of results for an extended period. Many influential studies were widely accepted and became part of the foundational knowledge of the discipline without sufficient replication. \n\nMoreover, there\u2019s the issue of publication bias. Journals are more likely to publish studies that report significant results, which means that studies that fail to replicate often go unnoticed. This creates a kind of skewed perception of the reliability of findings, and it can take time for the community to recognize the implications of this bias.\n\nFinally, I think it\u2019s important to consider that the social dynamics within research communities can slow down the recognition of problems. Researchers, especially those who are well-established, may resist acknowledging failures in their own work or in the work of their peers.

The paradox is that while we have more information, our ability to process that information effectively is still limited by our cognitive capacities. \n\nMoreover, biases such as confirmation bias or the availability heuristic can actually be exacerbated by the internet.

You know, behavioral economics has certainly provided us with insights into human behavior, but applying those insights to something as complex as political polarization is challenging.\n\nWhat we know from research is that people often rely on heuristics and cognitive biases when forming opinions. For example, confirmation bias leads individuals to seek out information that supports their existing beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence. This can create echo chambers, especially in the age of social media. \n\nOne approach might be to design interventions that encourage exposure to diverse viewpoints. For instance, if we can create environments\u2014whether online or in-person\u2014that promote constructive dialogue among individuals with differing opinions, we might reduce polarization. There are studies that suggest that when people engage in discussions with those who hold opposing views, they may not only understand the other side better but also recognize the common ground.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize the limitations of what behavioral economics can achieve. Changing deeply held beliefs and identities is not just a matter of providing information or nudging people in the right direction. It often involves emotional factors and social dynamics that are not easily addressed.\n\nMoreover, it turns out that the methods we might use to encourage open-mindedness could also backfire if they are perceived as coercive or if they threaten people's identity. So, any initiative must be approached with care, ensuring that it respects individuals' sense of agency.\n\nIn conclusion, while behavioral economics offers valuable insights, reducing political polarization is a multifaceted problem that requires not only understanding human behavior but also addressing the underlying social and cultural factors.

You know, the first thing I would say is that while my research can provide insights into decision-making, it's important to recognize the limits of what we can glean from psychological studies when it comes to personal choices.\n\nWhat we found was that people often rely on heuristics\u2014mental shortcuts\u2014that can sometimes lead to errors in judgment. For example, the availability heuristic suggests that people tend to overestimate the importance of information that comes easily to mind. So, if a student has recently heard about a particular college or career path, they might overvalue that option simply because it's more salient in their mind.\n\nAnother key concept is the distinction between System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; it can be helpful in certain situations but is prone to biases. In contrast, System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and analytical. When making significant decisions like college or career choices, it's beneficial to engage System 2 as much as possible\u2014taking the time to weigh options, consider the long-term consequences, and even seek out diverse perspectives.\n\nHowever, I should emphasize that every individual's situation is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It's also crucial to think about the \"experiencing self\" versus the \"remembering self.\" What you think will make you happy in the future might not align with your actual experiences. It's often the case that people adapt to their circumstances, and the initial excitement of a new opportunity can fade over time.\n\nIn practical terms, I would encourage students to gather information, reflect on their values and interests, and perhaps even try out different experiences through internships or volunteer work. They should also be aware of their own biases\u2014like overconfidence in their predictions about future happiness\u2014and be open to adjusting their plans as they learn more about themselves and the world.\n\nUltimately, while we can provide frameworks for understanding decision-making, the actual choices will depend on individual preferences, circumstances, and a bit of trial and error.

We ought to have normative theories that are adapted to who we are as people, as humans. And the idea of consistency \u2014 it's completely infeasible for a finite mind, and we have finite minds. So on that ground alone, it would be questionable as the principle for a normative model. But in addition, one would want a normative theory that takes into account human nature, which the principle of consistency doesn't.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a profound question, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my thoughts on this. You know, traditional neoclassical economics relies heavily on the idea of rationality, which presumes that individuals make decisions by optimizing their utility based on complete information and coherent preferences. However, what we\u2019ve found in behavioral economics is that this model often doesn't reflect how people actually think and behave.\n\nInstead of using rationality as a benchmark, I suggest we consider \"reasonableness\" as a more applicable standard. Reasonableness acknowledges the limitations of human cognition, the presence of biases, and the context in which decisions are made. It suggests that people do not always behave in ways that maximize utility in a rational sense, but they can still make decisions that are sensible given their circumstances and the information they have.\n\nTo identify and define reasonableness, we might look at decision-making processes that take into account psychological realities. For instance, we can evaluate how people actually respond to risk, uncertainty, and social pressures. One way to operationalize this is through empirical observations of behavior in real-world settings rather than relying solely on theoretical models.\n\nWe could also explore the concept of \"bounded rationality,\" which Herbert Simon introduced. This recognizes that while people strive to make rational choices, they do so within the limits of their knowledge and cognitive capacities. We can assess reasonableness by examining whether decisions are consistent with these bounds, rather than whether they adhere to an idealized notion of rationality.\n\nAdditionally, we might consider the role of emotions and social influences in decision-making. The work of my collaborator, Amos Tversky, and myself on heuristics and biases illustrates how people often rely on mental shortcuts that can lead to reasonable, if not perfectly rational, outcomes. \n\nUltimately, reasonableness as a normative framework should be grounded in a realistic understanding of human behavior, incorporating insights from psychology and behavioral research. This approach allows for a more nuanced view of decision-making that aligns better with the complexities of human nature.",
