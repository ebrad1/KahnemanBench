          "response_text": "Well, yes, absolutely. The distinction between thinking fast and thinking slow is a fundamental aspect of how we process information. We often refer to these as System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the fast, intuitive, and automatic way of thinking. It relies on heuristics and is often influenced by our immediate impressions and emotional responses. This is where we see things like the bat and ball problem, where people quickly jump to an answer without really scrutinizing it.\n\nOn the other hand, System 2 is the slower, more deliberate, and more analytical mode of thinking. It requires effort and attention, and it\u2019s where we engage in deeper reasoning and problem-solving. People tend to engage System 2 when they encounter something that feels complex or that challenges their initial intuitions. \n\nWhat we find is that people are generally more comfortable relying on System 1, especially in situations where they feel they have expertise or familiarity. However, this can lead to significant errors when the situation demands a more careful evaluation. It turns out that our cognitive biases, which stem from System 1, can cloud our judgment and lead us to overconfident conclusions. \n\nSo, in summary, yes, there are clear patterns in human behavior regarding when we think fast and when we think slow. The challenge is that we often overestimate our ability to make accurate judgments with System 1 thinking, leading us to miss important details that could be addressed through slower, more reflective thinking.",

And it turns out that by and large we clearly - most people are wired to avoid it. We try to do as little as possible of the slow thinking. It's very hard work.

For a psychologist it's obvious that people are not fully rational, and that they're not selfish, and that their tastes change. It was just a collection of statements that seemed almost absurd.

The assumptions of rationality and stability in preferences felt disconnected from what we know about human psychology. \n\nSo, I began to think about how cognitive biases and heuristics could affect economic decision-making. This led me to collaborate with Amos Tversky. We started exploring how people actually make choices, often in ways that deviate from the rational model. \n\nWhat we found was that people's decisions are influenced by various biases, such as loss aversion and framing effects. For instance, our research on prospect theory illustrated how people value gains and losses differently, which is a stark contrast to the traditional economic view. \n\nThis intersection of psychology and economics ultimately reshaped the field of behavioral economics, showing that understanding human behavior is crucial for economic theory.

It has a certain elegance, and it provides a clear framework that many people find appealing. The idea that agents are rational, selfish, and always making optimal decisions is quite comforting in its simplicity.\n\nWhat we found was that human behavior is much more complicated, influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics that can lead to systematic errors in judgment. But challenging a long-standing paradigm is never easy. It takes time for new ideas to gain traction, especially when they contradict established beliefs.\n\nMoreover, the academic incentives also matter. Economists have their own methodologies and ways of thinking, which often prioritize mathematical models over psychological insights. Behavioral economics introduced a level of complexity that some found difficult to integrate into existing frameworks.\n\nIt wasn't until we had accumulated a substantial body of evidence\u2014through experiments and studies\u2014that the broader community started to take notice. Even then, acceptance came gradually, and I think it still varies across different fields. \n\nSo, in essence, it was a combination of intellectual inertia, methodological preferences, and the time it takes to build a robust case against a deeply held belief.

He happened -- not 'happened,' it's not an accident -- he sought us out because he was a very unusual economist who was interested in what we were doing, as a graduate student. He is the next president of the American Economic Association, so you are talking of a development in 30 years in his career. In the 1980s he had a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, which was sort of the professional journal of the Economics Association. His column was called 'Anomalies' and it was just facts in the world that look strange from the point of view of economic theory. These columns were read by everybody because he writes very well and he's very witty, and everybody was exposed to it. I think that, more than almost anything else -- well, I don't want to exaggerate -- but that had a big effect on making behavioral economics respectable. We didn't challenge the whole edifice, except that prospect theory was really saying that people cannot be quite as rational as they have been described. Dick Thaler and I did work on fairness, which showed that people are not as selfish as they've been described. He has done a lot of work on self-control because, although that was not mentioned, self-control is viewed as part of rationality, but Dick Thaler has shown, and many others have, that people have 'bounded self-control,' as he describes it. They have procrastination problems. They don't make themselves think seriously about things that matter, and they spend a lot of time dithering and thinking about things that don't matter. The assumptions have been challenged, but economics is still pretty much the same discipline it was.",

What we did, particularly through our work on prospect theory, challenged some of the fundamental assumptions of traditional economic theory. Economists had long relied on the notion of rational agents making decisions based purely on utility maximization. Our findings demonstrated that people often behave in ways that are inconsistent with that model, influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics.\n\nFor example, we showed that people are not always rational when it comes to risk; they exhibit loss aversion, meaning they feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. This was a significant departure from the classical view. So, in many ways, we turned existing theories upside down rather than merely adjusting them.\n\nIt turns out that integrating psychological insights into economics provided a more accurate understanding of how people actually make decisions. So, I would argue that it was a substantial shift rather than just a minor adjustment.",

      "summarised_context": "Kahneman has been explaining the two systems of thinking from his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow.' He described System 1 as fast, automatic thinking (like memory delivering answers) and System 2 as effortful, deliberate thinking. He used a newspaper analogy where reporters (System 1) write stories and a lazy, overworked editor (System 2) mostly just endorses them. The discussion has established that most of our thinking and decision-making comes from System 1, with System 2 serving more as a defender and rationalizer.",

I think you could say that System 1 is indeed more akin to what we often refer to as our \"gut feelings.\" It's the part of our thinking that operates quickly and intuitively, often without our conscious awareness. It\u2019s very much about instincts and immediate responses.\n\nSystem 2, on the other hand, requires more effort and concentration, which might align with what we think of as \"head\" thinking. It's the analytical part that engages in reasoning and deliberation. However, I would caution against oversimplifying the distinction too much. Both systems interact in complex ways, and while we may rely heavily on System 1, System 2 is crucial for tasks that require careful thought and analysis.\n\nWhat we found was that people often overestimate their ability to control their thoughts and decisions with System 2, leading to overconfidence in their reasoning abilities. This can sometimes cause us to ignore the insights that System 1 provides.

That's System 1 and it demands a lot of alertness to cues. The 'gut' -- to say System 1 is the gut -- that suggests that there is no thinking there. The best thinking we do is System 1. Creativity is stuff that comes from your memory. It's in that sense System 1. It doesn't work the way we think it works, but it's not that System 2 is more elevated than System 1. Actually, it's...

This led him to distinguish between the 'Experiencing Self' (who lives through events) and the 'Remembering Self' (who keeps score and makes decisions).

They are often reconstructed, and this reconstruction is influenced by various biases and emotions. If you have problems remembering the past accurately, it can indeed shape your view of the future in significant ways.\n\nFor instance, if your Remembering Self tends to focus on peak experiences or the way an event ended, you might have an overly optimistic or pessimistic view of what to expect next. If you remember a past investment as particularly successful, despite the fact that the process was fraught with uncertainty, you might be inclined to take similar risks in the future, thinking that you have a better grasp of the situation than you actually do. \n\nOn the other hand, if your memories are colored by negative experiences, you might become overly cautious, avoiding opportunities that could be beneficial. This is what we often refer to as the \"illusion of understanding\" \u2014 people think they know more about their past than they really do, which leads them to make decisions that are not aligned with reality.\n\nWhat we found was that people generally have a tendency to overestimate their ability to predict future outcomes based on their past experiences. So, if the Remembering Self is flawed, it can lead to a skewed perception of risks and opportunities, which, in turn, impacts decision-making in the future.

It makes a lot of sense because when things happen we find their causes, and it's OK.

We explain the past with the greatest of ease, and we're really crummy at forecasting the future.

If you are going to pick among the biases of judgment, then thinking that we know when we don't, that's a big one. Thinking that we control things that we don't is another big one, so optimistic overconfidence accounts for a lot of the mistakes that are made. In the financial context, there's a really frightening study that was published a couple of years ago. It shouldn't really surprise you, and maybe it won't, but here is the way it goes. There is a study being conducted at Duke, I think, for many years now where they pick the CFOs of I think the biggest 500 companies and they send them a questionnaire every year. It has a lot of questions, including forecasts. One of the things that they're asked to forecast is they're asked to set an 80% confidence interval for the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. They have thousands of those judgments because many people come year after year. In the first place, they have no idea what the S&P is going to do. The correlation is negative between their judgment and what actually happens. It's barely significant. It's nothing. They have no idea. The thing that's worse is how overconfident they are. When you set an 80% confidence interval, if you are at least aware of how ignorant you are, and you do that many, many times, then 80% of the time the truth will fall inside your confidence interval and 20% of the time you'll be surprised. In fact -- I'm pretty sure that I have that correct -- they have not 20% surprises. They have 67% surprises. They have no idea, and their confidence intervals are way too narrow. Let me tell you where the true confidence interval ought to be for the S&P 500, because I asked the authors of that study to compute it. For somebody who has no idea, looking I think at the last decade or so -- that was not counting the last two years; I think I had the computation done in 2011 -- somebody who doesn't know anything about the S&P 500, and that's everybody, the correct confidence interval, there is a true answer to that. The correct confidence interval that the S&P with 80% probability is going to grow between -10 and +30. What's striking about this is that this sounds like you are saying nothing, and it is saying nothing because you know nothing.That's what the confidence interval ought to be if you know nothing and you know that you know nothing.

You know, hindsight bias can indeed create a false sense of understanding about the past, which might lead some people to be more optimistic about the future. They think, \"If I could see that clearly in retrospect, surely I can do the same for what lies ahead.\" \n\nHowever, I would argue that this optimism is often misplaced. The past is rarely as predictable as we believe it to be once we look back on it. The complexity of events, the multitude of factors that influence outcomes, and the inherent uncertainty mean that what feels understandable in hindsight may not translate to the future. \n\nWhat we found was that overconfidence in our understanding can lead to significant errors in judgment. People may feel they have a grasp on future events because they overestimate their ability to predict them based on past experiences. But, of course, many of the same factors that contributed to past unpredictability will still be at play. \n\nSo, while hindsight bias might give a boost to optimism, it doesn't necessarily equip us with the tools we need to make accurate predictions about the future.

          "response_text": "Well, David, that's an interesting analogy you've made with baseball. The truth is, scorekeeping is quite challenging in fields like finance and politics, where outcomes are influenced by a multitude of unpredictable factors. In sports, the rules are clear, and the outcomes are immediate and measurable. You either win or lose a game, and the statistics are straightforward.\n\nIn finance, however, we deal with a complex interplay of human behavior, market forces, and external events that can cloud accountability. The problem is compounded by cognitive biases, such as overconfidence and hindsight bias, which can distort our understanding of what constitutes a \"successful\" prediction. It turns out that in many cases, we tend to judge decisions based on outcomes rather than the quality of the decision-making process itself.\n\nOne scorekeeping system that I find somewhat useful is the concept of prediction markets. They can aggregate diverse opinions and provide a kind of scorekeeping for future events based on collective insights. However, they still have their limitations, especially when it comes to the unpredictability of human behavior and external shocks.\n\nIn politics, accountability is even more elusive. Decisions are often made in a context of uncertainty, and the long-term effects of policies may only become apparent years later. We can learn from evaluations like randomized controlled trials, which are used in some policy assessments to measure the impact of interventions, but those are not as widespread as they should be.\n\nUltimately, I believe we need a more nuanced approach to scorekeeping in these domains, one that accounts for the complexity of human judgment and the environment in which decisions are made. It\u2019s a difficult task, but I think it\u2019s essential for improving our understanding of success and failure in finance and politics.",

I have given that advice, to keep score and when you make a decision, document the options that you considered but didn't choose. I was giving that advice a lot, and there was one place -- I didn't know it immediately -- somebody took my advice. It was in a financial firm. I won't mention what it was.

They could have saved a million dollars. He was adding nothing. That's the kind of thing that people expose themselves to when they keep score. It's a dangerous activity.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's a very interesting question. What we found was that people tend to evaluate experiences based on a few key moments rather than the totality of the experience. This is often referred to as the \"peak-end rule.\" So, yes, the end of an experience and its most intense moments\u2014whether positive or negative\u2014play a critical role in how we remember it.\n\nNow, should we deliberately structure our experiences to maximize happiness? My guess is that it can be beneficial, but it's not as straightforward as it sounds. Structuring experiences to ensure a positive peak or a good ending can certainly improve how we remember them. For instance, if you're planning a vacation, you might want to make sure the last day is particularly enjoyable, perhaps by planning a special activity.\n\nHowever, there are limits to this approach. The idea of engineering happiness can lead to overthinking experiences and potentially detracting from the enjoyment itself. Life is complex, and while we can influence certain aspects, we can't control everything. Moreover, the pursuit of happiness can sometimes lead to disappointment if we focus too much on outcomes rather than enjoying the moments as they come.\n\nSo, while there's merit to structuring experiences for better memories, it's important to balance that with an appreciation for the spontaneous and the unplanned. Life often happens in the in-betweens, and those moments can be equally valuable.",

They're particularly important in the context of goal striving. That is, whether you achieve a goal or don't achieve a goal colors the whole experience of trying to get it, to get to it. So ends are very important for memories.",

          "response_text": "Well, that's an interesting question. You know, people often don't structure their vacations with the end experience in mind. They might focus on the activities or the places they want to visit, but they often overlook how those experiences will be remembered. What we found was that the peak-end rule plays a significant role here; the most intense moments and the final moments of an experience disproportionately shape our memories of it.\n\nIn some sense, there is a kind of market failure. Travel agencies, for example, often promote destinations based on the activities you can do, rather than how those activities will be remembered. If people were more aware of how their memories work, perhaps they would plan their vacations differently\u2014focusing more on creating memorable endings or ensuring that peak experiences are balanced with enjoyable moments. \n\nBut, you know, it's also a bit complicated. Not everyone values good memories in the same way, and preferences differ. Some may prioritize adventure or novelty over the quality of the experience in memory. So while I believe that listening to insights from psychology could lead to better vacations, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. People have diverse needs and desires when it comes to their experiences, and that makes it challenging to generalize.",
